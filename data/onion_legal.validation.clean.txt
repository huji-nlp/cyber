Apcalis Oral Jelly is a popular and successful treatment for erectile dysfunction. Containing the same active ingredients as Cialis, patients can benefit from an effective treatment time of at least 36 hours. This allows couples to engage in intercourse at a natural time. Unlike tablets, Oral Jelly is easy to swallow and is very quickly absorbed into the body. Apcalis has been previously supplied under the trade names Kamagra Plus & Erectalis. This longer effective treatment time has gained the drug the nickname, 'Le Weekender' in France. The medical name for Apcalis is Tadalafil and it belongs to the PDE-5 family of vasodilators. These drugs work by dilating the blood vessels in the body; particularly around the genital area. This in turn, allows stronger blood flow to enable an erection to take place. Apcalis Oral Jelly is not an aphrodisiac and stimulation will be required to develop an erection. Due to the lower overall dose of 20mg, many patients report lower side effects.
