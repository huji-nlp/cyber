A smoke bomb just makes a large amount of smoke from a little device. They are kind of fun to play with and relatively safe.
First you need a good casing. To make a paper tube cut a piece of brown paper grocery bag or craft paper that is about 3 inches wide and 12 inches long. Now roll this around a 5/8-inch dowel rod with some wood glue smeared on the paper to make a tube. Pull the tube off the dowel when done rolling and cu the ends off the tube because they most likely itelescopedi out. Cut the tube to about 2-4 inches in length or bigger depending on how big of a smoke bomb you want.
Take your dowel rod and insert it in the tube but not all the way. Leave a space at the end so you can fill the end part of the tube with Durham's rock hard water putty. Mix up some putty and fill in the cavity of the tube where the dowel is not filling. Let the end cap dry.
Cut out two circles of cardboard so they fit inside the tube. These are the end caps. Now put one of them inside the tube and fold the slits you cut in the tube over the cardboard circle and glue it all down. Put a piece of duct tape over this to hold it in place and make it stronger. Wrap some electrical tape or duct tape around the side near the end to secure the other tape over the end cap of the tube.
Take the other piece of cardboard and poke a hold in the center of it for the visco fuse. Cut a piece of fuse and measure 1-inch and mark this spot on the fuse with a marker. Push the fuse in the hold you poked so that you can just see the mark you made on the fuse. It is probably a good idea to label the bottom of the fuse assembly so you know where it is. The bottom is the part with the 1-inch of fuse sticking out. The inside is the part where you can just barely see your mark on the fuse. Now glue the fuse in place with some epoxy or other strong glue. Note in the picture it shows a straw. You don't need the straw there and I suggest not using it because it messes up the timing of the fuse. Ok now you have your fuse assembly done.
Roll a piece of regular white printer paper around a dowel rod that is about 5/8-inch diameter with some white glue. This will make another small tube made form the paper. Slit the end of the tube like you did for the toilet paper roll and fold it over each other and glue and tape it to seal off one end of this small tube. Now cut this tube to the right length to be able to fit inside the toilet paper roll. This tube is for your bursting charge to break the shell in the air.
Just light the fuse and get away. The fuse will hit the sticky match, which will move down the tube and hit the black powder at the bottom. This black powder fires the shell in the air and ignites the delay fuse on the shell. When the delay fuse gets inside the shell it'll hit the black powder there bursting the shell and igniting the stars inside throwing them out in the sky.

Never use any metal containers for fireworks only paper tubes and MAYBE that is a maybe plastic or PVC tubes. Plastic can still be a potential shrapnel hazard! Also that doesn't mean paper won't hurt when it hits you.
Never make anything in large quantities.
First you need to weight out all you chemicals of the color you wish to make and mix them together preferably with a ball mill and some marbles for a few hours.
