FAQ: Can I buy BTC with paypal?
Answer: Yes and no. Some vendors on localbitcoins offer this option but most of the vendors do not offer paypal as payment option. There is a simple reason. BTC transactions cannot be reversed, if they were sent to a correct wallet address. But paypal payments can be reversed. To avoid this scam-opportunity the most of the BTC-Sellers do not offer to buy bitcoins with paypal.
Most accepted payment options are Credit Cards and some kinds of direct Bank transfers.
During the payment process, you have to enter your wallet address to receive your bitcoins. Now the bitcoins should have have arrived in your wallet.
As you can see, there are not many ways to buy bitcoins anonymously because of the payment options.
But all Bitcoin transactions are public, traceable, and permanently stored in the bitcoin network.
Tumbling your bitcoins is like to put them in a big washing machine with tons of other bitcoins from other people. At the end you'll get randomized bitcoins. To receive the washed btc you should create a second wallet. (One wallet for the regular bought bitcoins and one virgin wallet only for the washed ones)
That makes it really hard to trace the btc. These tumbling services are not for free. You have to pay a fee.
Also note that these tumbling services are usually illegal. In the past, there were confirmed scams committed by some of the tumbling services. To check the actual status of the different services use the following link

Welcome to my personal shop for cannabis products!
I am an experienced dark market vendor/grower located in Spain. My main goal is to provide my customers with probably the best cannabis products in Europe at the lowest prices possible. After all the struggles and losses on the dark-net markets I decided to open up my own shop. I think that this is a win-win situation. This way you profit from lower prices on all your favorite products (as there are no additional fees) and I am more secure of market exit scams and falling Bitcoin rates.
I am doing this for living and to feed my family, so always expect from me professionalism and continuity. Happy and returning customers is what I want!:)
We only accept Bitcoins for payments.
2. Can I pay in hand?
3. Where can I buy Bitcoins?
4. Is it safe to order at your shop and what happens with my shipping
Yes, it is absolutely safe! Otherwise I would not be doing this for so long:). Two weeks after your order is shipped (and there are no complains from your side) your PGP encrypted address gets automatically deleted from the shop's database. That's why you have to put in your address in the according field each time you place a new order.
6. Do I have to sign for my package when it arrives?
No, you don't need to sign for it. It will be dropped into your mailbox.
7. What are the next steps after purchase?
8. I have paid, but order status still pending after 1 hour, what
9. How much time do I have to pay after checkout?
I recommend no more than 2 hours. Sometimes Bitcoins price is very volatile. If the Bitcoin rate falls extremely I can put your order on hold or refund it if the price has varied significantly. Note that the shop updates the Bitcoin price each 10 minutes to keep it as accurate as possible.
It depends, take note that we don't ship on weekends (postal service don't work) But to give an idea: GER 3-7 days FR 3-7 days UK 7-12 days
If you haven't received your product within 15 days from set as "Sent" please contact us opening a support request ticket from inside your order. This does not guarantee anything. Refunds/reships always depend on the customer's trustworthy.
11. Can I purchase products without shop registration?
No, I decided remove this option because I had problems with users forgetting to add their address and order number. After 2-3 weeks then I receive messages asking about it. This was really annoying because it happened every week...
12. Is JavaScript necessary to view the shop?
Yes, products are "variable" this means they have multiple prices depending on the selected amount. This is a JavaScript function and you can't add products to the cart without JavaScript being enabled (you can just enable it to and then disable again).
13. I lost my account password. Can I recover it?
Usually no, due to security reasons email password recovery is turned off. Please create a new account or contact us giving some ownership proof to reset password.
14. Can I have a discount for big orders?
Usually no, the prices are already very good. Anyway you may contact me and I can evaluate depending on multiple factors.
15. I have some more questions before buying. How can I contact you?
17. Last time I had ordered the site was offline for many days. Can
Well, I have redesigned the site completely. Also server config and hosting. I know that it is always a risk, nobody is risk free to be attacked on this places (also happens a lot on clearnet sites, so imagine how it is on the darknet...) but I have learned a lot from the past and now the site auto-backups on a safe emergency server daily. So, if something bad happens, I can restore all the site without loosing anything.
18. What about the quality of your products? I want to know what I'm
My products always come from very qualified growers. I do not buy anywhere and every batch I purchase is checked under the microscope. If it does not meet my quality standards I don't buy it, no matter whether it is a trusted provider or not. There are times when a batch is not as good as expected. (c) Elherbolario 2016
