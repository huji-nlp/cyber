From now until Tuesday, 27% discount for all 20g orders of Bubble Gum and Big Skunk strains!
Hello everyone! First of all, before I forget Urgent shipping are now available!
I bring news about extractions of hashish, now are divided into 3 classes: 1st Quality, 2nd Quality, 3rd Quality.
I made these extractions myself, and I can guarantee there is no shit added.
I have the great pleasure to present my own "Charas" directly extracted from the resin stick on trimming scissors, when the plant is still alive.
Try it yourself, and discover why is is considered the smoke of the gods
Have a nice shopping day!

This week I will make quantitative measurements (qualitative are always the best that I can) to know the e t price per gram of each extraction (time, material, weed needed) thanks to my new equipment, it is possible that prices of all extractions fall significantly, maintaining the same quality that you are accustomed. But don't expect 7EUR per gram
EDIT 1: I forget to say that very soon a new type of shipment will be added for any kind order: URGENT without tracking. (For what says postal service is like half time shipping, but knowing the lazy Spanish postal service... do not expect to save more of 30% of time compared with regular shipping, use at your own needs!)

I added some few more units of Dry Hash and also new "sample" listing.
Now customers can try our product and service making just a small order to know us first! :)
I can make a long and boring description of procedure but..I'm lazy today If ayone are interesed, just google the names :)
Jelly Hash (BHO Dry Hash)
It seems that history is doomed to repeat itself forever?
I've always thought that the more people manage money, the more risk there.

Open a ticket for more info :)
Critical Mass Hydrophonic growed added for sale!
Here a little bit of info from leafly.com
Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk 1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.

I take this opportunity to announce that I have just received another strain, formerly was the one that had more sales:
ElHerbolario Posted on 906 09/03/201610/03/2016 by 907 ElHerbolario
opening a new ticket here in the shop.
4. If everything is OK you are going to receive a coupon code for 1g
during purchase and you will receive 1g for free of the strain that you have ordered.
Wanted editor to create a custom guide on how to buy bitcoins.
What is needed on guide? - It must be totally noob friendly, detailed step by step. (may be nice include some screenshots too, is just an idea) - Guide may be divided in 2 parts: 1- How to buy Bitcoins. 2- How to buy here with it. - Avoid copy/paste other tutorials. - Easy to be posted on site, don't make a PDF file
If you have some free time and correct spelling, there is a reward: 20g at your choice of any strain on sale free shipping.
Thanks, ElHerbolario Posted on 917 07/03/2016 by 918 ElHerbolario

Hi, I sign this message to prove my identity. (read this message entire to know how verify this)
First of all I would like to apologize to my clients for the lack of communication during the last 10 days. It has not been easy...believe me!
I appreciate all customers who have placed an order after the February 18, to contact me by email to: elherbolario@sigaint.org to check the status of your order (it will be difficult but not impossible, and fortunately I have a temporary registration which can be useful) I repeat again, contact to SIGAINT email. Lelantos are abandoned cause the DDOS attack happened some weeks ago.
I sign this message with my PGP key to prove my identity. You can verify the validity of the key in "Grams" in the following link: http: grams7enufi7jmdl /infodesk/vendor/0x3606DA418DA3DB32 Just copy entire message (like a pgp encrypted message) then paste in your PGP software and click on "verify" You will see that this message have been signed by ElHerbolario (elherbolario@lelantos.org) (if you change only one letter of this message, verification fails)
To finish this message, I would just like to add two things:
To my customers, I apologize for any inconvenience I might have caused, I hope to restore service and communication in the next few hours.
Those who have caused all this: You will not get a penny from me. You can continue or try somewhere else. But if you have some dignity, you will stop playing with livelihood of an entire family.
