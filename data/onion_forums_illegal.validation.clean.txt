II. How to buy bitcoins
First you have to search for a seller for your bitcoins. (You can search via 983 for example). Please note, that some sellers are restricted in some countries.
Some examples for reliable sellers:
German banks have issues with it. Commercial seller)
restricted in many countries
Answer: Yes and no. Some vendors on localbitcoins offer this option but most of the vendors do not offer paypal as payment option. There is a simple reason. BTC transactions cannot be reversed, if they were sent to a correct wallet address. But paypal payments can be reversed. To avoid this scam-opportunity the most of the BTC-Sellers do not offer to buy bitcoins with paypal.
During the payment process, you have to enter your wallet address to receive your bitcoins. Now the bitcoins should have have arrived in your wallet.
As you can see, there are not many ways to buy bitcoins anonymously because of the payment options.
But all Bitcoin transactions are public, traceable, and permanently stored in the bitcoin network.
III. Tumbling or not
Tumbling your bitcoins is like to put them in a big washing machine with tons of other bitcoins from other people. At the end you'll get randomized bitcoins. To receive the washed btc you should create a second wallet. (One wallet for the regular bought bitcoins and one virgin wallet only for the washed ones)
That makes it really hard to trace the btc. These tumbling services are not for free. You have to pay a fee.

Customers who have a online Blockchain-Wallet can use the embedded 'Shared Coin' option to tumble Bitcoins (easiest and fastest way):
If you are very paranoid, buy very huge amounts of dope or live in a very restrictive country you should tumble.

Welcome to my personal shop for cannabis products!
I am an experienced dark market vendor/grower located in Spain. My main goal is to provide my customers with probably the best cannabis products in Europe at the lowest prices possible. After all the struggles and losses on the dark-net markets I decided to open up my own shop. I think that this is a win-win situation. This way you profit from lower prices on all your favorite products (as there are no additional fees) and I am more secure of market exit scams and falling Bitcoin rates.
I am doing this for living and to feed my family, so always expect from me professionalism and continuity. Happy and returning customers is what I want!:)
We only accept Bitcoins for payments.
2. Can I pay in hand?
We recommend 1125 Happycoins for immediate coin receive or
address after i received my order?
Yes, it is absolutely safe! Otherwise I would not be doing this for so long:). Two weeks after your order is shipped (and there are no complains from your side) your PGP encrypted address gets automatically deleted from the shop's database. That's why you have to put in your address in the according field each time you place a new order.
5. What about your shipping stealth? Can the product be smelled from
Please understand that due to security reasons I can't give out many information about the used stealth. But here are some important facts: I use business envelopes with printed sender and return addresses All products are double vacuum sealed. You will not be able to smell anything until you open the package. The package will blend in perfectly with your daily mail. All my packages fit into the standard mailbox slots.
6. Do I have to sign for my package when it arrives?
7. What are the next steps after purchase?
As soon as your payment is received in full, your order status will be set as "Procesing". You can check the status anytime on you account page.
8. I have paid, but order status still pending after 1 hour, what
9. How much time do I have to pay after checkout?
I recommend no more than 2 hours. Sometimes Bitcoins price is very volatile. If the Bitcoin rate falls extremely I can put your order on hold or refund it if the price has varied significantly. Note that the shop updates the Bitcoin price each 10 minutes to keep it as accurate as possible.
10. How long does it take until I receive my product?
It depends, take note that we don't ship on weekends (postal service don't work) But to give an idea: GER 3-7 days FR 3-7 days UK 7-12 days
If you haven't received your product within 15 days from set as "Sent" please contact us opening a support request ticket from inside your order. This does not guarantee anything. Refunds/reships always depend on the customer's trustworthy.
13. I lost my account password. Can I recover it?
Usually no, due to security reasons email password recovery is turned off. Please create a new account or contact us giving some ownership proof to reset password.
14. Can I have a discount for big orders?
Usually no, the prices are already very good. Anyway you may contact me and I can evaluate depending on multiple factors.
15. I have some more questions before buying. How can I contact you?
16. I'm afraid to order and don't receive it...
