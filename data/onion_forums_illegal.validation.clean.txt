That makes it really hard to trace the btc. These tumbling services are not for free. You have to pay a fee.
Customers who have a online Blockchain-Wallet can use the embedded 'Shared Coin' option to tumble Bitcoins (easiest and fastest way):
If you are very paranoid, buy very huge amounts of dope or live in a very restrictive country you should tumble.

Welcome to my personal shop for cannabis products!
I am an experienced dark market vendor/grower located in Spain. My main goal is to provide my customers with probably the best cannabis products in Europe at the lowest prices possible. After all the struggles and losses on the dark-net markets I decided to open up my own shop. I think that this is a win-win situation. This way you profit from lower prices on all your favorite products (as there are no additional fees) and I am more secure of market exit scams and falling Bitcoin rates.
1. Which payment methods do you accept?
We only accept Bitcoins for payments.
Yes, you can go to pick and pay the order at your nearest police station...LOL! NO! OF COURSE NOT!
4. Is it safe to order at your shop and what happens with my shipping
address after i received my order?
Please understand that due to security reasons I can't give out many information about the used stealth. But here are some important facts: I use business envelopes with printed sender and return addresses All products are double vacuum sealed. You will not be able to smell anything until you open the package. The package will blend in perfectly with your daily mail. All my packages fit into the standard mailbox slots.
7. What are the next steps after purchase?
As soon as your payment is received in full, your order status will be set as "Procesing". You can check the status anytime on you account page.
8. I have paid, but order status still pending after 1 hour, what
9. How much time do I have to pay after checkout?
I recommend no more than 2 hours. Sometimes Bitcoins price is very volatile. If the Bitcoin rate falls extremely I can put your order on hold or refund it if the price has varied significantly. Note that the shop updates the Bitcoin price each 10 minutes to keep it as accurate as possible.
10. How long does it take until I receive my product?
It depends, take note that we don't ship on weekends (postal service don't work) But to give an idea: GER 3-7 days FR 3-7 days UK 7-12 days
If you haven't received your product within 15 days from set as "Sent" please contact us opening a support request ticket from inside your order. This does not guarantee anything. Refunds/reships always depend on the customer's trustworthy.
11. Can I purchase products without shop registration?
No, I decided remove this option because I had problems with users forgetting to add their address and order number. After 2-3 weeks then I receive messages asking about it. This was really annoying because it happened every week...
Yes, products are "variable" this means they have multiple prices depending on the selected amount. This is a JavaScript function and you can't add products to the cart without JavaScript being enabled (you can just enable it to and then disable again).
13. I lost my account password. Can I recover it?
Usually no, due to security reasons email password recovery is turned off. Please create a new account or contact us giving some ownership proof to reset password.
Usually no, the prices are already very good. Anyway you may contact me and I can evaluate depending on multiple factors.
15. I have some more questions before buying. How can I contact you?
Create an user account and then open a support ticket.
16. I'm afraid to order and don't receive it...
I can't help with this if you aren't convinced, but keep in mind that I do this to support my family, so it will not be very smart to scam people. Maybe you should check forums, reddit, deepdotweb about me first... my advice is keep yourself always informed before buying from any darknet vendor.
17. Last time I had ordered the site was offline for many days. Can
Well, I have redesigned the site completely. Also server config and hosting. I know that it is always a risk, nobody is risk free to be attacked on this places (also happens a lot on clearnet sites, so imagine how it is on the darknet...) but I have learned a lot from the past and now the site auto-backups on a safe emergency server daily. So, if something bad happens, I can restore all the site without loosing anything.
18. What about the quality of your products? I want to know what I'm
My products always come from very qualified growers. I do not buy anywhere and every batch I purchase is checked under the microscope. If it does not meet my quality standards I don't buy it, no matter whether it is a trusted provider or not. There are times when a batch is not as good as expected. (c) Elherbolario 2016
