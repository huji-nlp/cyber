As the school year comes to an end, we will be holding one final DMOPC in the form of the Don Mills Programming Gala.
Schools wishing to provide their students with an opportunity to enrich their programming skills while competing against schools from across the GTA are invited to participate!
There will be a Bronze, Silver and Gold division, with each having MATH: <semantics> <mn>6</mn> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">6</annotation> </semantics> :MATH problems. Bronze -- the Bronze division will be roughly the difficulty of the Junior Division of the CCC and the Gr. 10 to 11 ICS curriculum. Only the last few questions require knowledge of array manipulation and sorting. Silver -- the Silver division is modeled after previous DMOPC difficulties. Problems from past DMOPC contests can be found 15 on the judge. Topics will range from intermediate logic to some more advanced algorithms. Gold -- for very experienced contest programmers highly confident in their programming ability. The Gold division provides an advanced problemset well beyond the curriculum, and will contain problems of CCO and IOI difficulty.
Participants may decide which contest to participate in on the day of the competition.
Teachers / supervisors can register their school by completing the
After submitting a response, an email containing additional information and instructions will be sent out to the email address of the supervisor to confirm the registration.
The cost to participate in this event is MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant "normal">$</mi> <mn>10</mn> </mrow> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex"> $10</annotation> </semantics> :MATH per student, which is due upon registration as a cheque payable to Don Mills Collegiate Institute.
To encourage collaboration, teams of MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>1</mn> <mo>-</mo> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">1-2</annotation> </semantics> :MATH students are allowed, but each team is allowed one computer. Schools are allowed to send any number of teams, as long as the total number of participants does not exceed 20.
Note: Both the quantity and composition of teams must be determined by the registration deadline.
