Hello guys!! After some well deserved vacations, here we are, back online. The site is now cloud based and there have been many changes to the code. As a result, you might see some weird glitches here and there. We'll do our best to have everything working smoothly as soon as possible so please bear with us. The guys from the site staff are already back, please take a moment to visit our 46 forums and say hello. As before, the forums are separate from the main site login so you will need to register there separately. Enjoy your stay, and welcome back :) - The Demonoid Site Staff
