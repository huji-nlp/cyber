If nothing else the rabbit should have erred on the side of convincing me it works, rather than punishing you at the expense of me starting to doubt its efficacy. Then again, my personal luck isn't that bad. I did have the chance to use my onahole for the first time in months, and twice in one weekend to boot. It's noisy, harder to conceal both in use and cleanup than normal fapping, and rarely am I alone in the house, so I have to be patient and take what chances I get.

It did a good job of blending the original, not only in art style but also in tone, while updating it and modernizing it in an appropriate and respectful way. I'm not sure how I feel about the OP, though, it's good, but it doesn't feel like it has the right tone. The ED is spot on, though.Also, there's a lot of good screencaps to get, but some things are only up for a frame or so, so it's hard to grab then without slowing down or advancing one frame at a time.Anonymous  04/04/17 (Tue) 02:21:24 No.404941 I dunno, I'm personally not feeling it for the first episode.For the old series, I didn't feel bad for the victims getting taken for the Salesman's Wild Ride because they started out digging their own graves, most prominent in my mind while writing this was the kid at the horse races. This one, I kinda do since that feeling of "oh, this blundering fool is looking for the easy way out in life and the Salesman is gonna take them on the Wild Ride" isn't initially present, especially for the OL who had it (relatively, in respect to her current position in life) kinda hard emotionally.

If you feel like you could use some more magic, then add stuff like witchery and ars magica to the mix. If you wanted to try something more technological, then they have more than enough mods to satisfy your autism, maybe. Some other good ones I can recommend are archimedes ships, bibliocraft, artifice, and chocolate quest.

Anonymous  04/03/17 (Mon) 21:56:33 No.404818[Reply]I am a little bored and got the idea to Black Stories with you guys. Here are the Instructions: You get a vague story about a Character's death and you have to guess him and the anime the character is from. You may ask questions and I'll answer with either yes or no.First one goes like this: His life was in this Characters friends' hands but that was way too much pressure.9 posts and 1 image reply omitted.

On the anime he just gets really hurt, on the manga he dies.Anonymous  04/05/17 (Wed) 21:22:47 No.405177 >>405175And you are indeed correct:During a test, the entry plug of Touji's EVA unit was infected by bacteria like angel that practically took it over. Shinji fought and tore it apart until only the infected Entry plug remained. To contain the attack, commander Ikari, Shinji's own father forced him to crush the entry plug with his unconcious friend inside through a remote override of EVA 01's control. It was literally and figuratively way too much pressure.Anonymous  04/07/17 (Fri) 13:58:20 No.405193 >>405170No.Delete Post [ File] Password Reason [Global]Previous [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] | Catalog[ home / manage ]- Tinyboard + vichan + infinity 727190d9c3 -Tinyboard Copyright © 2010-2014 Tinyboard Development Groupvichan Copyright © 2012-2014 vichan-develinfinity Copyright © 2013-2015 Fredrick Brennan & Infinity Development Groupmoemoekyun~
