                                   Sulfur


    Sulfur (also called brimstone, gardening sulfur, and dusting sulfur)

                                 Formula: S

    Sulfur can be purchased at agricultural stores or hardware stores. I
   have seen this stuff at places like Wal-Mart and Lowe's. It is sold in
     the gardening section as dusting sulfur. It is used to put on your
     garden to keep bugs away. You can find it in 5 pound bags for about
   $5.00. This is a really cheap price because in most compositions sulfur
                            is used very little.

    Potassium perchlorate is hard to find and usually expensive, but well
     worth it. You can buy it from chemical suppliers off the Internet,
      which require identification usually, or it can be purchased from
    online auctions such as [http://www.ebay.com/]www.ebay.com . I found
    some on ebay for about $16.00 a pound. Sometimes the auctions require
   identification as well. It can also be made at home through a laborious
                         process as described here:

                                 Smoke Bombs


    A smoke bomb just makes a large amount of smoke from a little device.
           They are kind of fun to play with and relatively safe.

   First you need a good casing. To make a paper tube cut a piece of brown
     paper grocery bag or craft paper that is about 3 inches wide and 12
    inches long. Now roll this around a 5/8-inch dowel rod with some wood
    glue smeared on the paper to make a tube. Pull the tube off the dowel
   when done rolling and cu the ends off the tube because they most likely
   ìtelescopedî out. Cut the tube to about 2-4 inches in length or bigger
               depending on how big of a smoke bomb you want.

     Take your dowel rod and insert it in the tube but not all the way.
   Leave a space at the end so you can fill the end part of the tube with
      Durham's rock hard water putty. Mix up some putty and fill in the
   cavity of the tube where the dowel is not filling. Let the end cap dry.

   Ok now drill a 1/8î hole in the center of the paper tube for the fuse.
   Cut a piece of fuse and put it in the hole and hot glue it in place or
     us other glue. WANRING: DO NOT DRILL THE HOLE AND FUSE IT AFTER YOU
                              LOAD THE POWDER!

                          White Smoke Composition:

                           Potassium Nitrate - 12

                                 Sulfur - 16

                                Charcoal - 1

                        (optional) Baking Soda - 3.5

    To mix the powder you can just mix it with a spoon or something but I
   recommend putting it in the ball mill for about an hour or so to get a
             really good mix and a finer, better burning powder.

     Ok now to load the powder after fusing is done. Fill the tube with
   smoke powder and make sure you leave space for the other end plug. Put
   a piece of paper or tissue paper in the tube now and fill the remaining
   space with water putty or epoxy to for another end plug. That is it you
                     should now have a good smoke bomb.

                          Diagram of a smoke bomb.

               Finished smoke bomb wraped in electrical tape.

    UPDATE: If your smoke bombs are flaming too much and not smoking try
   adding 12% baking soda to the formula to slow down the burn and make it
                      start smoking more than burning.

                               Canister Shells


    An aerial shell is probably one of the most popular fireworks today.
   They are shells fired out of a mortar and when they reach a height they
                explode giving a sphere of different colors.

    To make an aerial shell save up some toilet paper tubes. That's right
    these work great for a cylindrical shell. Get a toilet paper tube and
   cut slits on both sides of the tube so they can be folded over to close
                                off the ends.

   Cut out two circles of cardboard so they fit inside the tube. These are
    the end caps. Now put one of them inside the tube and fold the slits
   you cut in the tube over the cardboard circle and glue it all down. Put
       a piece of duct tape over this to hold it in place and make it
    stronger. Wrap some electrical tape or duct tape around the side near
       the end to secure the other tape over the end cap of the tube.

    Take the other piece of cardboard and poke a hold in the center of it
     for the visco fuse. Cut a piece of fuse and measure 1-inch and mark
     this spot on the fuse with a marker. Push the fuse in the hold you
     poked so that you can just see the mark you made on the fuse. It is
    probably a good idea to label the bottom of the fuse assembly so you
      know where it is. The bottom is the part with the 1-inch of fuse
   sticking out. The inside is the part where you can just barely see your
    mark on the fuse. Now glue the fuse in place with some epoxy or other
    strong glue. Note in the picture it shows a straw. You don't need the
   straw there and I suggest not using it because it messes up the timing
            of the fuse. Ok now you have your fuse assembly done.

   Roll a piece of regular white printer paper around a dowel rod that is
    about 5/8-inch diameter with some white glue. This will make another
    small tube made form the paper. Slit the end of the tube like you did
   for the toilet paper roll and fold it over each other and glue and tape
     it to seal off one end of this small tube. Now cut this tube to the
   right length to be able to fit inside the toilet paper roll. This tube
         is for your bursting charge to break the shell in the air.

     Fill the small tube you made with black powder and place it in the
     center of the toilet paper roll. Pack stars around this tube in the
    remaining space in the toilet paper roll. Now place the fuse assembly
   cardboard end cap on making sure the fuse goes inside the black powder
     charge tube. Fold the slits over the end cap/fuse assembly and glue
   them in place. Put some tape over this and wrap tape around the outside
      near the end like you did for the other end to secure everything.

   Now wrap the shell with some cotton twin or string. Wrap it vertically
     and horizontally. This is called spiking the shell and it makes it
   stronger and can make it burst better. Tie off the string and now wrap
                    the whole shell in some masking tape.

   Take a razor and slice the end of the fuse. Smear some wet black powder
   on the end of the fuse and let it dry. This is called priming the fuse
   and it'll make sure it lights during firing. Congratulations you have a
                              shell completed!

   Now you have to load the shell in a mortar with lifting powder. Fill a
     small plastic bag with black powder so it is able to fill about 3-4
   inches of the mortar tube. You may have to do some experimenting on how
   much lifting powder you need to launch the shell. Ok now put a piece of
   sticky match or quick match in the tube of the mortar so the fuse hangs
   out over the top of the mortar for you to light. Now arrange the black
     powder bag with the shell so the fuse is down on the shell into the
     black powder bag. Push these into the mortar tube. That is with the
     black powder bag then shell with fuse down into the tube. Now your
                           shell is ready to fire.

    Just light the fuse and get away. The fuse will hit the sticky match,
    which will move down the tube and hit the black powder at the bottom.
   This black powder fires the shell in the air and ignites the delay fuse
    on the shell. When the delay fuse gets inside the shell it'll hit the
     black powder there bursting the shell and igniting the stars inside
                        throwing them out in the sky.

                                   Safety



   When handling fireworks you must follow some general rules for safety.
   Most of the rules are common sense so please use common sense when
   dealing with pyrotechnics.

   •  DO NOT smoke when anywhere near fireworks!

   •  Never use any metal containers for fireworks only paper tubes and
   MAYBE that is a maybe plastic or PVC tubes. Plastic can still be a
   potential shrapnel hazard! Also that doesn't mean paper won't hurt when
   it hits you.

   •  Know the chemical properties before using any kind of chemical. Know
   what you are dealing with and realize the potentially unstable states
   of chemicals.

   •  It is best not to have any kind of lamp on your workbench where
   fireworks are made due to the heat they can put out and the electrical
   sparks that can happen.

   •  Wear safety glasses, gloves, face shield, dust mask, ectà when
   working with fireworks.

   •  Beware of carpeted areas and watches and static clothing due to
   static charges that can build up in them. This can set off fireworks!

   •  Always ask yourself what would happen if this went off now. Never
   hold a firework in your hand while lighting it.

   •  DO not throw fireworks at other people and be sure all spectators
   including yourself are clear of the area where a firework is being set
   off.

   •  Treat flash powder with extreme caution. This stuff is friction,
   spark, flame, impact, and static sensitive. And most of the time it
   will react with acids and sulfur and phosphorus and can spontaneously
   ignite. Never have loose flash lying around.

   •  Never make anything in large quantities.

   These are some basic rules you should follow. This is not all of the
   safety rules out there and you should familiarize yourself with more by
   searching for more fireworks safety. Other safety rules and cautions
   will be stated in the pages corresponding the material(s) on that page.
   Please don't do anything stupid and treat fireworks with respect and
   care.

                                    Stars


       Stars are the things that make the color and burn in the sky in
   fireworks such as aerial shells, mines, roman candles and many more. To
     make these little burning beauties is relatively easy. Here I will
   teach you how to make cut stars. Also I will only provide formulas that
     I use that are easily accessible with the chemicals listed on this
     site. This limits us to only a few colors but it is good if you are
    just starting out. If you wish to make different colors of stars do a
    search on the Internet or look them up in a book. There are many more
   bright fantastic colors out there but the chemicals to make them can be
                              hard to come by.

   First you need to weight out all you chemicals of the color you wish to
   make and mix them together preferably with a ball mill and some marbles
                              for a few hours.

                                   White:

                            Potassium Nitrate 75

                                 Sulfur 26.8

                                Charcoal 3.6

                            Gold and Silver Rain:

                            Potassium Nitrate 60

                                  Sulfur 6

                                 Charcoal 39

                                   Yellow:

                            Potassium Nitrate 69

                                  Sulfur 22

                                 Charcoal 14

    Now mix in some hot water with your mixture and make a slush that is
       thick and gooey. Spread this slush out on some waxed paper to a
   thickness you like, the thicker the stars the longer the burn. Let this
         dry. Now take a razor knife and cut the dried slush in to a
   checkerboard formation. Cut them into little squares any size you want,
      the bigger the size the longer the burn. These cubes you made are
           called stars. That is all you need to do to make stars!

                    Some gold and silver rain cut stars.

                            Acetyl salicylic acid

                               Formula: C9H8O4
      This is just plain aspirin. Buy a bottle of it at your local drug
                   store. This will be used in making TNP.


      Aspirin contains other additives that must be removed to get pure
    acetyl salicylic acid. To do this take your aspirin tablets and crush
   them with a hammer or coffee grinder or something. Now add the crushed
      aspirin tablets to some hot or warm acetone and most of it should
      dissolve. Acetyl salicylic acid dissolves in acetone. I warmed my
     acetone on a hot plate. Now filter this solution and throw away the
      filter and the stuff in the filter. Take the filtrate (the liquid
      acetone) and either let it evaporate or warm it on a hotplate to
    evaporate it faster to obtain the pure acetyl salicylic acid. Let the
        acetyl salicylic acid fully dry and then it is ready for use.

                                Flash Powder


     Flash powder is extremely dangerous if it is not handled with care.
    This powder is friction sensitive, shock sensitive, spark sensitive,
     heat sensitive, and it doesn't like a bunch of other chemicals like
     sulfuric acid and sometimes sulfur. You must have great respect for
                      this stuff when working with it.

    Ok to make flash powder is easy. Weigh out your chemicals first while
   wearing a dust mask, rubber gloves, and goggles at all times during the
                                  process.

                             Aluminum Powder 30%

                          Potassium Perchlorate 70%

    Never make anymore than 10 grams of this powder at a time for safety
   reasons. Also it is good not to do this around carpeting and cotton and
    take off your watch so static can't spark the mixture. Also make sure
    there is no desk lamps and such in the area or other sources of heat.
                      Also make sure the area is clean.

   Ok put the two chemicals on a piece of paper. Mix them by shifting the
    paper around so the chemicals overlap on top of each other until they
    are mixed. Doing this makes it so you aren't touching the mixture and
   it is really soft on it and doesn't mix it harsh like beating it with a
   spoon would. Never ball mill this stuff either. Ok now that you have it
    mixed you are done. This is flash and it is really powerful so don't
                            get careless with it.

     Never leave loose flash laying around in the open and clean up any
   spills right away! It is best to load the powder right away into tubes
   for use as m80's or what ever you are doing with it. See the section on
                  m80's for the construction of the device.

   Also note that there are many other flash powder mixtures out there but
    i feel that this is the safest and more powerful of the mixtures out
      there. This is the same mix used in commercial m80's and salutes.

                 This is an open burn test of flash powder.

                                Firecrackers


     The firecrackers here are just small firecrackers filled with flash
    powder. These take very little powder and are a little safer than the
    m80's but they are still very loud and can still be dangerous. These
          are great in that they cost practically nothing to make.

   Fist get a roll of duct tape and cut a piece of tape about 6 inches in
    length. Put down a piece of waxed paper and put the tape sticky side
   down on the waxed paper. Now roll the duct tape round a 1/8-inch dowel
     rod to form a tube with the sticky side outside and the smooth side
    inside. Now take another piece of tape about 1 inch in length and put
    it around the outside of the tube to cover up the sticky side. I like
        to use red duct tape here to make the firecrackers look red.

   Now cut a little of each end off to make it look nicer due to the tube
   telescoping. It may seem hard to roll the tubes at first but with some
     practice you can do a lot in a short amount of time. I can probably
                   make about 100 tubes in 30 min or less.

    Ok now you have your casing. Cut a piece of fuse about 1.5 inches in
   length. Put the fuse in the tube about ½ to ¼ the way. Apply a little
    hot glue around the fuse and tube on this side to secure the fuse and
                               seal the tube.

    Now fill the tube though the bottom with flash powder. I use a folder
   index card with the powder on it to fill the tubes. Now cap off the end
       of the tube with epoxy and let it dry. You now have a finished
                                firecracker.

     You can use these single or you can tie them together in strings to
                        make them go off in sequence.

                              Ammonium Nitrate

                               Formula: NH4NO3

    Ammonium nitrate has numerous applications as an oxidizer and is used
     extensively in explosives. It can be used as a nitrate in nitration
    processes or as an explosive when mixed with numerous other chemicals
                               and compounds.

   Ammonium nitrate can be purchased at the drug store or pharmacy section
    of your local store. It is sold as instant cold packs or instant cold
     compress. It is used for pain relief. When you buy the package make
   sure you can shake it and hear solid inside. If it is all liquid and no
   solid then the bag of water inside the package broke and your ammonium
    nitrate is useless. Now to get the ammonium nitrate carefully cut the
   outer bag open on the edge making sure not the break the smaller inner
    bag of water. Now just dump out the powdered ammonium nitrate into a
   zip lock plastic bag and store in a dry place. Ammonium nitrate is very
     hydroscopic and will pick up moisture from the air and rendering it
    useless so therefore make every effort to keep it dry. Also you will
      have to ball mill or use a coffee grinder to powder the prills of
                     ammonium nitrate from the package.

               Instant cold compress pack form Kmart pharmacy.

    Read the back of the package for the list of contents. It should say
                              ammonium nitrate.

                                 PYROTEKNIX

                                  Thermite


    Thermites are pyrotechnic compositions which a reactive metal reduces
       oxygen from a metallic oxide. This produces a lot of heat with
       extremely high temperature output. The most common thermite is
      ferroaluminum thermite, made from aluminum, which is the reactive
      metal, and iron oxide, which is the metal oxide. When it burns it
   produces aluminum oxide and pure molten iron. Thermite is usually used
    to cut or weld metal and is used by the military to burn and destroy
   weapons, equipment, and documents. Thermites are generally safe to make
    and handle and store. It takes a significant amount of heat to ignite
    thermite so therefore a starting fire mix must be used to ignite the
   thermite. A starting fire is a mixture that is easier to light and can
                 produce enough heat to ignite the thermite.

                               Starting fire:

                            Potassium Nitrate - 5

                              Aluminum powder 3

                                  Sulfur 2

    I wouldn't store this starting fire mix without the addition of some
       boric acid to keep the potassium nitrate from reacting with the
                                  aluminum.

   Also a burning magnesium ribbon works for igniting thermite. And if you
      are in a real pinch for igniting thermite, sparklers may burn hot
                       enough to ignite the thermite.

                           Ferroaluminum Thermite:

                             Aluminum powder 25%

                           Iron Oxide (Fe2O3) 75%

   Course aluminum is preferred here since it will make the thermite burn
   longer and expose the target to more heat for a longer period of time.
     I didn't have course aluminum at the time so I used 600 mesh German
    aluminum. Using this fine powdered aluminum makes the thermite burn a
                                 lot faster.

   Just mix the two chemicals together for thermite. I placed a small pile
    of this thermite powder on a metal shovel and ignited it with a small
   pile of the starting fire mix listed above. I just dumped the starting
     fire on top of the thermite pile and ignited the starting fire with
                                safety fuse.

             the video of the ferroaluminum thermite burn test.

    This picture shows the molten iron after the burning of the thermite
          was complete. It did not burn through the shovel however.

                              Potassium Nitrate


   Potassium Nitrate (also called saltpeter, niter, or nitrate of potash)

                                Formula: KNO3

    Potassium nitrate can be obtained from many sources. I personally buy
    it from Lowes hardware store as Green Light stump remover. It is sold
    for about $4.00 a pound. Other stump removers work too but not all of
    them are potassium nitrate so be careful and read the labels. I found
      that Green Light is the best kind to get because it is already in
                    powdered form and it is pretty pure.

      Potassium nitrate can also be purchased from ww.ebay.com or other
   online auctions. It can usually be found here in larger quantities for
     relatively cheap. Some auctions may require identification for the
                              purchase though.

     Another place to find potassium nitrate is from chemical suppliers.
      There are many company's that sell it but practically all require
             identification and proof that you are 21 or older.

     I have also heard this chemical can be purchased as fertilizer and
    large bags from some agricultural stores. I personally have not seen
     any of this but if you find it it'll be a large supply for a cheap
                                   price.

   And the last place I have seen this stuff at is in drug stores. You can
    usually ask for it over the counter in small quantities for a pretty
    steep price. This stuff is really pure but it will cost you a lot of
                                   money.


                               Sodium Nitrate

                               Formula: NaNO3

    Sodium nitrate can be used in substitution of potassium nitrate with
        little or no difference in performance. There are very little
                  differences between these two chemicals.

    I have found sodium nitrate for cheap at a local farm supply store as
   fertilizer. I bought the 4 lb boxes of it for about 5 dollars. They did
    say they sold 50lb bags as well but I am unsure of the cost. The name
   on the box is ìBonide Nitrate of Sodaî and has the fertilizer numbers
                                   15-0-0.

                               Canister Mines


     A mine is a pyrotechnic device that throws stars directly out of a
       mortar. They are relatively simple to make and are great for a
   beginner. This tutorial covers canister mines, which look a little more
       professional, and function a little better than the bag mines.

                       First get a toilet paper tube.

                     Cut both ends of the tube like so.

     Cut a notch in one end of the tube and insert sticky match into the
         tube and runt he rest of it along the outside of the tube.

    Fold the cut portions of the tube over and tape everything in place.

             Fill the bottom half of the tube with black powder.

                  Fill the top half of the tube with stars.

        Now fold the cut portions of the tube over the stars and tape
                      everything to secure it in place.

     Wrap some tape around the outside of the tube to secure the sticky
           match to the side and to make it look a little better.

     You now have a completed mine! Just drop it in a 2 inch mortar and
                           light the fuse to fire.

                              Acetone Peroxide


                              Acetone Peroxide

                        Detonation Velocity: 5300 m/s

                               Formula C9H18O6

      This is commonly referred to as acetone peroxide because it is a
       mixture of isomers. It is also called tricycloacetoneperoxide,
                 triacetonetriperoxide, TATP, AP, TCAP, and
               3,3,6,6,9,9-hexamethyl-1,2,4,5,7,8-hexoxonane.

    This explosive is extremely easy to make and the chemicals are easily
   found. There are actually two isomers of acetone peroxide, the first is
     tricycloacetone peroxide, which is what will be made here, and the
     second is dicycloacetone peroxide. Both of these compounds are very
   similar, but the reaction seems to favor the tricyclo over the dicyclo
     at lower temperatures. The tricyclo isomer is more stable and more
   powerful than the dicyclo, which is why every effort is made to prepare
   the former. Both isomers will be made in the reaction with the tricyclo
                        being the principal product.

       Acetone peroxide is extremely unstable; this cannot be stressed
          enough! Acetone peroxide is said to be more unstable than
   nitroglycerin! I would suggest making this explosive shortly before it
      is desired to use it as it is never wise to keep unstable primary
   explosives around too long. It can be stored rather safely under water
    for some time. If allowed to stand in the open it will vaporize after
   some weeks. If stored in a sealed container it may crystallize into the
   crevices of the cap, which could detonate from the friction of opening.
     Mixing with RDX, PETN, or picric acid will improve the stability of
                               this explosive.

   To make acetone peroxide you will need Acetone, Hydrogen Peroxide (3%),
    and Hydrochloric acid (about 35%). See the chemical pages for details
                     on where to obtain these chemicals.


     Now measure out 150ml of hydrogen peroxide and 50ml of acetone in a
     glass measuring cup or beaker or graduated cylinder and mix the two
      together in a glass jar or beaker. Now place the beaker with the
    mixture in an ice bath to cool it down to about 5 degrees Celsius. An
          ice bath is just a plastic tub with ice, water, and salt.

   Now measure out 50ml of hydrochloric acid in a glass beaker and add it
   to the acetone/peroxide mix slowly drop by drop keeping the temperature
   of the mix around 5-10 degrees Celsius. If the temperature raises above
    10 degrees Celsius then stop adding the acid until it drops below 10
    degrees then continue adding the acid. It is very important that you
     moderate the reaction; high temperatures will lower your yield and
    cause the formation of the less useful dicyclo isomer. After you add
   all the acid continue stirring for 5 minutes. Now either keep this mix
   in the ice bath for 24 hours or place the mix in a refrigerator for 24
                    hours. A white precipitant will form.

   Now filter the white crystals out with a funnel and coffee filter. Wash
    the crystals with sodium bicarbonate water by mixing some baking soda
    with water and pouring it though the filter with the crystals in it.
     Now dry the crystals in open air for about 3 hours and it should be
                                ready to use.

   In about 24 hours the yield of acetone peroxide should be about 5 grams
     but I filtered in 6 hours and got a gram or less because this is my
           first time with the explosive and that is all I wanted.

                  Acetone Peroxide formation after 6 hours.

          Acetone Peroxide scraped from filter onto a spoon to dry.

    Here is a burn test of some still damp Acetone Peroxide (less than 1
                             gram in the open).

                                   Rockets


      Sky rockets are great fun but are a little more complicated of a
   firework to make. You can't just ram the propellant in a case and make
     it fly; you have to have a core through it to give it the power it
                                needs to fly.

                                   CASINGS

    First off you need a casing. Now you can make your own casings out of
     paper grocery bags or craft paper. All you do here is get a ½ inch
   dowel rod and cut a strip of paper a little bigger than the length you
   want the case and about 12 or so inches long. In this case we need the
     case to be 4 inches so we will cut the paper at about 5 inches. Now
   roll the paper around the dowel with some wood glue. Now pull off your
    tube, which probably telescoped out at the edges. You can now cut the
    edges that telescoped out with scissors or a razor and cut the paper
    tube to a length of 4 inches. You now have a rocket casing made from
     paper. These casings work great and are really strong but they take
    some work to make a lot of them. I used to do this but now I have an
                                 easier way.

    My method of getting casings is much easier and less time consuming.
   You can go buy about 10 feet of ½ inch CPVC pipe at the hardware store
    for about 2 dollars. I use CPVC and not the PVC because it is thinner
               and lighter and makes a lighter rocket engine.

               The small PVC on the right is used for rockets.

   Cut the CPVC pipe into segments of 4 inches in length. Now take a knife
     or file and scrap up the inside of the tube on both ends to make it
                           hold the plugs better.

                                A cut casing.

                                 NOZZEL TOOL

     Pick up a 7/16-inch dowel rod at the hardware store and cut it to a
    length of about 1 foot. Measure in 3-3/8 inches from the end of this
     rod and make a mark. Wrap masking tape at this mark so you have the
   3-3/8 inches of wood showing. Build up the masking tape so it is pretty
    think and you can insert the wood part in the CPVC tube and the tape
   stops it from going any further. This is you depth gauge for making the
                            nozzle of the engine.

                       The depth gauge for the nozzel.

                                   NOZZELS

    Put the dowel in the CPVC tube until it hits the masking tape and you
   should have a space inside the tube at one end that is empty. Fill this
       space with Durham's rock hard water putty (see glue section for
    details). Now pull out the dowel slowly making sure the putty stays.
                        Let the putty dry over night.

   Ok now you should have a hard putty plug in your tube. Go drill a hole
    through it in the center of the putty cap that is 1/8-inch diameter.
                       This is your completed nozzle.

                                 CORING TOOL

   Ok now to make some more tooling. Cut a bock of wood and get a 1/8 inch
    steel rod form the hardware store. Take the wood block and cut a line
    across the top with a saw to form a groove that the steel rod can fit
    in. now drill a 1/8 inch hole in the board in the groove about center
    of the board. Drill another 1/8-inch hole a few inches away from the
     hole you just made in the same groove as well. Now you have a block
   with a groove and two holes in the grooves. Put the 1/8 inch steel rod
   through the one hole so it sticks out the side without the groove about
    4 inches. Bend the rod so it is flat on the groove and take it out of
    the hole and bend it again so it looks like a staple so the rod goes
    through the two holes with the rod protruding out on the side with no
       groove about 4 inches and the other hole is the rest of the rod
    protruding out on the same side. Now bend the side with the long rod
    sticking up down flat to the surface and cut it off so it is about 2
    inches on the surface. Cut the other rod protruding up at 2.5 inches.
      This is your coring spindle and is used to make a core through he
         propellant so it burns all at once giving it power to fly.

                             Slit cut in board.

                  Steel rod pushed through holes in board.

       Steel rod on the bottom of the board bent around like a staple.

                       bending the excess rod on top.

                          Finished coring spindle.

                                RAM ROD TOOL

     Now you need to make yet another tool. You need a ramrod to ram the
   propellant in the casing. Take a piece of 7/16-inch dowel rod and drill
    a 1/8-inch hole in the center of it as far as you can into the dowel.
                            This is your ramrod.

                                   Ramrod

                        Ramrod fits over the spindle.

                                 PROPELLANT

    Now it is time to mix up the propellant. I like the sugar propellant
   because it works good and packs nice. Weight out your chemicals and mix
             them in a ball mill with marbles for about an hour.

                            Potassium Nitrate 63

                              Powdered Sugar 27

                                  Sulfur 10

                           LOADING THE PROPELLANT

     Put the CPVC casing on the spindle you made so the nozzle is on the
   bottom. Put some propellant in the casing and use your ramrod with the
    hole in it to ram the propellant around the spindle. Keep adding and
   ramming propellant until you reach the top of the spindle. Now you can
    use the flat end of the ramrod to pack some propellant on top of the
   spindle about ½ inch. Now you have your casing filled with propellant.

                     Propelleant being rammed in casing.

                                  NOSE PLUG

     Fill the rest of the casing with Durham's rock hard water putty or
       epoxy to make an end cap. Let this dry. Pull the engine off the
   spindle, this leaves a empty core in the center of the propellant so it
    can burn form the inside to the edges giving it more surface area to
                       burn and there fore more power.

                             PRIMING AND FUSING

      Now you have to fuse the engine. Fill the engines core with black
   powder by pouring it in with a folded note card. Wet some black powder
    with water to make a slush and smear some on the end of the nozzle to
          hold in the loose black powder in the core. Let this dry.

    Now tape on a piece of black match or fuse to the dried black powder
     cap. And tape on a wooden barbeque stick or dowel to the side for a
       stick to launch and guide the rockets. You now have a completed
                                 skyrocket.

                              Wood BBQ sticks.

                            Finished sky rocket.

   If your rockets won't fly you need to make the core longer. If they are
   too powerful and blow up you need to make the core shorter. In general
     the core length should be 6-7 times the diameter of the rocket, the
   nozzle should be a little thicker than the diameter and the hole should
                           be 1/3 of the diameter.

                           Diagram of sky rocket.

   This stuff can be purchased in the medical isle or drug store for about
   1 dollar a liter. It is very common and most stores should carry it. It
     is most common in 3% solution. A higher percent will increase your
   yields in making explosives. But for the purpose of testing and making
                    small amounts 3% will work just fine.

    Other synthesis on this site requires a much higher concentration of
   hydrogen peroxide. The 3% that you can buy in most stores will not work
   for other explosives other than acetone peroxide. But you can also buy
     27% hydrogen peroxide as a non-chlorine swimming pool sanitizer. I
     bought a gallon of this as ìBaquacil Ultra shock and oxidizerî at
      Alpine pool and spa for about 15 dollars. It came in a purple jug
    inside a plastic bag with warning labels on it. Look on the label on
   the front to make sure it says ìcontains: 27% hydrogen peroxideî. Most
      pool suppliers should carry this stuff but note that most regular
                          stores will not have it.

                                  Ball Mill


    A ball mill is used for grinding stuff into a fine powder. It consists
     of a rotating drug with the chemical you want to grind and a grinding
    medium such as lead balls that do the grinding of the powder. The drum
    rotates and tumbles the powder and balls grinding it into a fine dust.
    One place to buy a ball mill is at toy stores or Wal-Mart. You can buy
    them as ìrock tumblersî. These rock tumblers are used by hobbyists to
     polish stones so they are smooth. You can pick one up for about 15-30
     dollars. Although you can get bigger more expensive ones off the net
     and actual ball mills from companies that sell them for about 60-100
     dollars. Or you could make your own and I'll leave that up to you to
                                  figure out.

   Ok so now that you have your ìrock tumblerî you need something to grind
    with. For grinding black powder and rocket fuel I use marbles. You can
    use lead shot from the gun department or brass also works (you can cut
     up a brass rod from the hardware store to make milling media). Never
    use steel! Because steel balls can spark and that will equal a bad time
    for you if your grinding black powder or other flammable mixture. Also
    don't grind mixtures that are unstable or sensitive. NEVER GRIND FLASH
                                  POWDER!!!!!

                                My "ball mill"

      A screen from the cooking dept. at your local store works well for
                seperating the milling media from the powders.

                               Formula: C4H8O

    Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) is sold at local hardware stores as a paint
   striper. I found pure MEK at Home Depot as a paint striper for about 5
   dollars a liter. It says right on the canister “Methyl Ethyl Ketone -
                                  M.E.K.”

   If you can't find pure MEK then you can find a more impure form as PVC
     cement. Look in the isle with the PVC pipe and there will be small
    canister of PVC cement and if you read the contents of the cement it
    should be MEK as the main component. There is other stuff mixed in as
      well but it shouldn't be too much of a problem when doing a MEKP
   synthesis. The other chemical in the PVC cement is usually acetone and
   this will produce acetone peroxide, which is another explosive that you
      should be familiar with (see elsewhere on this site). The acetone
    peroxide will be a white solid and it should not affect the MEKP that
                             is a liquid layer.

                                   Balance


   For pyrotechnics you're going to want to have a good balance. I got an
      Ohaus triple beam balance off of ebay for about 20 dollars. This
     balance had weights missing so I ordered them from the company for
   another 15 dollars. This is a good deal considering if you buy an Ohaus
   balance from the manufacture new it'll cost you about a hundred bucks!
   Balances can be quite expensive but they are very necessary if you are
    serious about pyrotechnics. Other cheaper alternatives could be diet
   scales used for measuring food or postage scales for weighing packages.
   These are not very accurate devices though. If you have a powder scale
               for reloading shells then that will work great.

   ]Picric Acid (TNP)



                                 PYROTEKNIX

                              Picric Acid (TNP)


                Picric Acid also called TNP or Trinitrophenol

                              Formula C6H3N3O7

                        Detonation velocity: 7480 m/s

     Picric acid is both a useful explosive compound and a precursor to
   other explosives. It is stable unless old, it will form a very unstable
    crystalline structure after many years. Today picric acid is used in
    detonators or booster charges. Picric acid reacts with metals to form
      unstable and explosive picrates such as lead picrate so keep this
                         chemical away from metals.

     First measure out 100mL of sulfuric acid and weight out 20grams of
           acetyl salicylic acid and 50grams of potassium nitrate.

   Heat the sulfuric acid to 60-80 degrees Celsius using a hot water bath
   or a hotplate. Now slowly add the acetyl salicylic acid and it may fizz
    a little. Once you add the acetyl salicylic acid to the sulfuric acid
     it will be a really dark color. Keep this mixture at 60-80 degrees
       Celsius for 30 minutes so the sulfuric acid converts the acetyl
            salicylic acid to phenol and then to phenol sulfate.

   Now take the mixture off the heat and add the potassium nitrate SLOWLY!
     It will fizz and bubble a lot so add the potassium nitrate is small
    portions. It took me about 1 hour to add all of the potassium nitrate
   to the mix. If you add it too fast a red gas will form, this is NO2 and
      it is toxic. Make sure you do all this outside or in a fume hood.

     After all the potassium nitrate is added cool the mix down to room
    temperature and then put it in an ice bath to cool it to 0-5 degrees
              Celsius. It will get really thick at this point.

   Now measure out 100ml of water and weigh out 200grams of ice. Place the
    ice and water in a large glass container and then add the cooled TNP
                 mix by scraping it all in to the same jar.

   The ice will melt and the mix will now be a nice yellow color. You will
             see crude TNP precipitate to the bottom of the jar.

    Once the ice melts filter the solution to obtain the crude TNP. Save
   the yellow liquid if you want more TNP. You can boil the yellow liquid
    down to about half it's volume and cool it to 0-5 degrees Celsius and
                   filter again to obtain more crude TNP.

   This crude TNP has sulfuric acid in it and it will be extremely hard to
               dry. To dry the TNP you will need to purify it.

   Take the crude TNP and dissolve it in 50mL of HOT water. Now cool this
    down to 0-5 degrees Celsius and filter the pure TNP out. This is much
                               easier to dry.

    [Left] Crude TNP with 50ml water. [Right] Some purified TNP for burn
       test. Note this was not all of the the TNP but only a portion.

   Make sure you wear goggles and gloves during this whole procedure. TNP
     stains everything it touches a nice bright yellow color. It is also
                         quite toxic so be careful.

      Some TNP crystals from a second crop from the same yellow liquid.

       A mortar is a device used to launch aerial shells or mines. It
     basically consists of a tube and a base. To make one you first need
   some PVC pipe. You can get PVC at any hardware store for pretty cheap.
    It comes in many different sizes. I made some 2-inch diameter mortars
   and some 3-inch diameter mortars so for this case I got 2 inch PVC and
   3 inch PVC. Now go cut a piece of wood or board to make a base for the
      mortar. Cut the PVC pipe to a length you like, I use about 1-foot
     length mortars. Now glue the PVC pipe standing on the board to the
    board with something like liquid nails or liquid welder or some other
      strong glue. Let it dry and paint it if you want, now you have a
                              finished mortar!

                      (Left) PVC pipes different sizes.

               Multiple mortars for launching simultaneously.

   I bought cornstarch at a local grocery store in the baking isle. It is
   very common and very cheap and this will be used in making nitrostarch.

                                Sticky Match


    Sticky match is used for firing shells and mines. It is nothing more
     than a type of fast burning fuse to reach the bottom of the mortars
     extremely fast. To make it lay out a length of 2-inch duct tape or
   masking tape that is a little longer than the mortar you are using. Now
    make a trail of black powder down he center of the tape stripe. Put a
   piece of fuse on one end of the trail of black powder so it sticks out
   from the tape. Take another piece of tape the same length as the other
    and place it over top of the tape with black powder on it. Press the
   two together and your done! Now you can use this in your mortar firing.
     You light the fuse and as soon as the fuse hits the trail of black
    powder in the tape it'll travel down the tape into the mortar really
                   fast lighting the shell or mine inside.

     Sticky match with trail of black powder and finished sticky match.

                                Black Powder


    Black powder is a big part of all fireworks. With out this stuff you
    are limited on what you do. You can buy black powder in gun shops for
   about $15 a pound for Goex FFFF black powder. It is used for reloading
   shells. If you buy it make sure you get black powder or gunpowder that
    is not the smokeless powder, which is an entirely different compound.

   Or you can make black powder at home for a much cheaper price, probably
     about 1/6 of the cost. First get all your chemicals gathered up and
                    weigh out each of them on a balance.

                            Potassium Nitrate 75%

                                 Sulfur 10%

                                Charcoal 15%

      Now take these chemicals and put them in the ball mill with some
   marbles to grind it and mix it really well. Run the ball mill for about
    4 hours. Now you can get a strainer or some large mesh screen to sift
    out the marbles form the powder or just pick them out. This fine gray
   powder is called meal powder and it is also useful in fireworks. But to
              make black powder we have to do a few more steps.

   Take the fine gray meal powder and mix it with some HOT water until it
    is a thick goo. Stir this good with a spoon. Now take your black goo
   mix and smear it out in a thin layer on some waxed paper. Let this dry
   for a few days up to a week. It should be brittle and not moist when it
   is dry. Now you can crush it up with a spoon and roll a thick dowel or
     pipe over it to make a fine black powder. You now have black powder
   that should burn really fast. This isn't as good as purchased stuff but
              it'll work just fine in your homemade fireworks.

   Note: Mixing the meal powder with water makes it burn much faster when
    dry because the potassium nitrate is water soluble and this allows it
     to get into the porous charcoal and will make a much faster burning
                                   powder.

                      Completed homemade black powder.


                      Black Powder: The Blender Method

     There is also another simpler and faster way of making black powder
     using a blender. This is good when you want a lot of powder faster
   and/or you don't have a ball mill. The powder made here is not as good
   as the ball mill method but it still works just fine for pyrotechnics.

    First weight out all you chemicals the same as above (using standard
    75/15/10 ratios). I would advise all your chemicals be a fine powder
   but it is not absolutely necessary. The finer the chemicals the better
    the powder. Throw your powder in a blender and add some hot water and
    stir it with a spoon. It should look like a thick slush of black goo.
    Never runt the blender with dry powder! This could cause a spark and
    you'll have a bad day. Now runt he blender with the wet goo of black
   powder for 5 or so minutes then let it settle or stir it a little with
     a spoon. Now run the blender for another 5 minutes making sure you
      don't hear anything chopping around. Hopefully by now you have no
    chunks and your black powder is mixed well and smooth. Pour the black
    powder goo on to some waxed paper or plastic bowel and let it air dry
     for a few days. After it is dry just break it up or crush it to the
     size of grains of powder you want the same as the previous method.

                                   Comets


   You can think of comets as over sized ingle shot roman candles, or the
        comet itself as a large star. They fire a large grain of star
   composition into the air from a mortar and it looks like a comet while
                               it is burning.

      First cut a piece of toilet paper roll so it is about 2 inches in
                                   length.

    Mix up your star composition that you want to use for the comet. See
     the stars page on this site for formulas. I used my ìyellowî star
   formula for this comet. Now wet the star powder with alcohol and mix it
   until it is a thick paste. I used alcohol instead of water so it would
   dry faster. Now place your 2inch toilet paper roll onto some wax paper
        and fill the tube with the star paste all the way to the top.

   After the paste dries a little and it will keep it's shape poke a hole
   in the center of it with a pencil or dowel rod with a similar diameter.
   Make this hole so it goes half way through the grain. This will make it
      so the comet burns a little faster and hopefully it will be done
              burning before it comes back down to the ground.

   Now let the comet sit for a few days to let it dry. After it is dry you
     can cut or peel off the cardboard toilet paper roll from around the
                    grain. This is now your dried comet.

   Now push the dried comet into a full-length toilet paper roll as far as
   you can with the hole in the grain facing into the tube. Mine didn't go
                  all the way into the tube but that is ok.

    Now cut the end of the tube so you can fold it over as shown. Make a
    notch in the end of thee tube also so you can inset you sticky match
                           and tape it into place.

   Now fill the remaining space of the tube with your lift powder of black
                                   powder.

             Fold the cut tube over itself and tape it in place.

     Now tape the entire tube up to make it look a little better and to
    secure everything in place. You now have a comet that is ready to be
      fired. Just drop this in a 2 inch mortar and you are ready to go.

                                 Black Match


   Black match is kind of like a cheap way of making fuse. It burns rather
   fast and unpredictably so don't use it for large salutes or fireworks.
    It can be used on rockets or other small devices. To make it wet down
   some black powder with water until it is a thick goo. Now dip a length
   of cotton twine into the wet black powder so the string is covered with
   the goo. Now lay the string out on some waxed paper to dry for a day or
      so. Now cut it in lengths to be used just like fuse. Note if you
     confine this it'll burn extremely fast like sticky match but in the
             open it'll burn slow but not as slow as visco fuse.

                                cotton twine.

                     Soaking twine in wet black powder.

                        Finished black match drying.

                                  Fireballs


   Fireballs are nice pretty ìexplosionsî that are a colorful orange. You
   mostly see this type of effect in movies. You can make one yourself out
   of a few simple items. First get a tin can such as a soup can or coffee
    can depending on how big of a fireball you want. Drill a hole in the
   bottom side of the can big enough to insert the fuse. Now put a bag of
    black powder in the can with the fuse in the hole touching the black
    powder bag in the can. Now put a bag of gasoline on top of the black
   powder and you have your fireball ready to fire. Light the fuse and get
   away! Note do not do this in an area that can easily catch fire because
     you will probably have some excess gasoline in the area and it can
     catch things on fire! Be care and don't light yourself on fire ok?

                            Diagram of fireball.

      Some fireballs but these don't look as good as some others that I
                             didn't get on film.

       Hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine , methenamine, or urintropine)

                              Formula: C6H12N4

     Hexamethylenetetramine or hexamine for short can be purchased as an
      emergency stove or a camping stove fuel. The military used to use
    hexamine stoves for cooking meals in the field. You can try military
     surplus stores for hexamine fuel. I found hexamine at a local farm
   supply store as Coghlan's Emergency Stove. It came with a stove and 24
   fuel tablets, which are hexamine. I got this all for $6.00. The tablets
    must be ground to a fine powder before use. I suggest using a mortar
                                 and pestle.

                               Formula: C3H6O

   Acetone is a very volatile flammable liquid, which is commonly used as
   a solvent. Acetone should be used in a well-ventilated area or outside.
   It can be purchased from almost anywhere. I found mine at Wal-Mart for
    about 4 dollars for about a liter. It will be in the painting section
                           sold as paint stripper.

                   Hexamethylenetriperoxidediamine (HMTD)

                        Detonation velocity: 4511 m/s

   Hexamethylenetriperoxidediamine, or for short HMTD, is another peroxide
   explosive similar to acetone peroxide. It has slightly more power than
    acetone peroxide but it is just as sensitive. This compound is still
   very dangerous and sensitive so extreme caution should be used. HMTD is
   also reactive with metals and can explode so contact with metal should
    be avoided. The synthesis is still relatively easy but the chemicals
          required may be harder to come by than acetone peroxide.

    First measure out 25mL of 27% hydrogen peroxide. This synthesis will
   not work with 3% hydrogen peroxide. I tried using 3% and I got no yield
     at all of HMTD so you must use more concentrated hydrogen peroxide.

   Place the hydrogen peroxide in the refrigerator or an ice bath to cool
                    it down to below 10 degrees Celsius.

    Now weigh out 7 grams of hexamine powder and weigh out 10.5 grams of
                             citric acid powder.

                     [Left] Hexamine [Right] Citric Acid

     Citric acid is used as a catalyst for the reaction. HCl can be used
                instead but this will result in lower yields.

     Now slowly add the hexamine to the chilled hydrogen peroxide making
       sure you dissolve all the hexamine into the hydrogen peroxide.

    After the hexamine is added now add the citric acid slowly to the mix
    making sure the temperature doesn't rise too much. I suggest holding
    the temperature at about 0-10 degrees Celsius. Now you should have a
   clear solution with everything dissolved. You may have some citric acid
   that didn't dissolve completely, this is ok and it doesn't matter that
                                    much.

    Let the mixture stand at room temperature for 24 hours. Make sure the
             temperature doesn't rise above 30 degrees Celsius.

    After the solution stand for 24 hours a white precipitate should have
   formed. This takes up most of the volume of the liquid and there should
                               be quite a bit.

       Add some water to the solution and mix it up and filter out the
   crystals. Wash with some more water and some sodium bicarbonate water.
                  Let the crystals dry at room temperature.

                            Final yield of HMTD.

   HMTD should not be stored for very long. It will decompose slowly over
                                    time.

                             Burn test of HMTD.
