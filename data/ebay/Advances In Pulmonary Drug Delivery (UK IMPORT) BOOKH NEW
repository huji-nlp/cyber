Synopsis
The respiratory tract has been used to deliver biologically active chemicals into the human body for centuries. However, the lungs are complex in their anatomy and physiology, which poses challenges to drug delivery. Inhaled formulations are generally more sophisticated than those for oral and parenteral administration. Pulmonary drug development is therefore a highly specialized area because of its many unique issues and challenges. Rapid progress is being made and offers novel solutions to existing treatment problems. Advances in Pulmonary Drug Delivery highlights the latest developments in this field.
