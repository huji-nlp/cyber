LiberTORian 9 will be available soon. Featured articles on Negativland and Agenda 2030 Here is an excerpt: Devo was mentioned in the last issue of LiberTORian, but now the band got in the news. It looks like the lead singer and synthesizer player, Mark Mothersbaugh, held a wedding on the anniversary of 9/11. So here's the the deal: They decided to have a wedding cake in the form of the twin towers, and had the guests cut into it with box cutter blade. Post truncated. Click Reply to view.
Funny story...I had been following this mans final thoughts for the last couple of weeks. this is/was his official website. It all began as a suicide threat. Mercer was supposed to kill himself on cam for us on 9/28. I love gore and red room/snuff content so I bookmarked and was eagerly awaiting for this raging individual to end his life for all of our entertainment. After the 28th, I noticed that Mercers webpage switched from suicidal tendancies to homicidal/hatefull tendencies. I find his art very interesting. I find his mind...very interesting. You can clearly see how this man was troubled...to a certain extent...well...enough babbling from me. I INTRODUCE TO YOU..AN INSIGHT INTO A MIND LIKE FEW OTHERS. ENJOY.
" No1Again 15/10/06(Tue)09:19:39 55 No. 56 18 Just to point out, this man killed 15 people in oregon shooting..but it was not his first time killing. He is a long time serial killer. The media refuses to tell us the entire truth..only bits and pieces. This man had been threatening to go on a rampage for over 3 weeks. If I were getting paid by the government...I would have probably made an effort to end this before it began...but it was not my battle to fight. Don't be fooled into believe that the government and media dont know about his personal web page...they just choose not to reveal this "sensitive" information...Well i say "FUCK THAT AND FUCK YOU" . I am no sheep nor will I be decieved by the wolf.

Now that FH2 is down and out I have migrated over to this new webhost that's apparently being hosted on a raspberry pie computer. It seems to be a little bit slow bandwidth wise but other than that everything seems fine. I no longer have to worry about the 250mb data limit on hosting that FH2 had, although my sites fairly light so I probably didn't have to worry anyways. Oh well, as long as there is a free webhost on the darknet Heidenwut will have a home.

Hi all! I'm proud to present my new shop with an amazing design, and heavily improved features!
- - From today 18th July to 18th August, both sites will be operational to make more easy customer migration.
I wanted to start with a clean fresh database, so customers will need to signup again in the new site.
I hope you will like it, get a detailed look and discover the new features!
Feel free to test it and find broken functions, your help will be welcome.
Here it is the ElHerbolario genuine onion adresses:

Hi guys! I'm sorry I have been away a week by serious family affairs that I can't give details... The store is e tly as is from the 7th of July (a week ago).
I apologize to those who may have been scared for a possible exit-scam or are waiting for your order to be marked as sent.
Thanks you for your understanding and patience. I'm updating myself with orders and messages. Pending order will be set as sent today.
And during the next few minutes I'll update the listings with stunning new strains!
Thanks for reading, and my apologizes for those who are waiting their orders,
Just I want to inform what will happen with weed prices for the next 2 months.
May you know (or not) that the summer time is very bad to grow indoors. Temperature is too high for a suitable grow conditions. Most growers already powered off his facilities some weeks ago.
I noticed that some customers ask me if this Amnesia Haze batch have less trichomes because weed photos on listing are not very shinny :)
So today I made some more pics with daylight (old ones was made with poor light) check it, same batch from previous pics!
This are HD pics, I posted without preview because I don't know why it reduces image size.

I just finished to packing...And I've run out of stock with California Orange and DEL: :DEL Amnesia Haze...
So, this was the bad news..and now the good news!
Imminent Amnesia Haze restock!! Expect it on 48h MAX.
Also Cannalope Haze restock next week. Already harvested some time ago, and currently drying.

I just received a new batch of Amnesia Haze!
Just look the pics speak itself!
I'm pleased to share with you this new strain!
Is 100% BIO growed. Producer have made very nice job as you can see how well trimmed is!
This strain is very good by his uplifting effects and by happiness that produces and his medical effects are good for stress.
You should try it before I run out of stock!
As tittle says! I think 7EUR/g is a fair price, so you can buy it until I get out of stock :)

From now until Tuesday, 27% discount for all 20g orders of Bubble Gum and Big Skunk strains!
Hello everyone! First of all, before I forget Urgent shipping are now available!
Extraction times are: 1st Quality 5 min, 2nd Quality 15 min, 3rd Quality 1 hour.
Not fool yourself about 2nd or 3rd quality. My 3rd quality beat any commercial hash that are sold on Darknet with different beautiful names but are the same shit.
I made these extractions myself, and I can guarantee there is no shit added.
Here I put some pictures to make reading more enjoyable
"Indian legends say that the charas is so good that even the very god Shiva smoked when he retreated to the mountains to meditate. The charas - which means hand extracted hashish, is one of the greatest treasures of the Himalayas."
Try it yourself, and discover why is is considered the smoke of the gods
Don't miss the ONLY 24h discount of 812 Dancehall strain! You get it at 4.99EUR/g!
Just 45 units of 10g added (450g total amount) Listing can be murchased multiple times, just I added like this to keep stock under control.
Have a nice shopping day!
Hello everyone! I bring some news that soon will rejoice the spirit and the senses!
New restock this weekend, I know what is going to add but just in case I publish later
I have already prepared all necessary tools to make regular cannabis extracts, so the goal is always to have everything. So, you only need one stop here to get all your desired cannabic products.
To summarize: - New strains in the next 48 hours. - Cannabis extracts PERMANENTLY listed. - Cannabis extracts probable price drop.
Thanks for visiting us!
I added some few more units of Dry Hash and also new "sample" listing.
Now customers can try our product and service making just a small order to know us first! :)
Check the nice pics of 830 Cannalope Haze and 831 Bubble Gum. (click on images to full-size view)
Here you can see how are made the cannabis extracts that you can buy (same ones, own pics)
I can make a long and boring description of procedure but..I'm lazy today If ayone are interesed, just google the names :)
Enjoy! Very soon listings up!
Drying Ice-O-Lator Hash (following pics made some weeks ago)
Jelly Hash (BHO Dry Hash)
It seems that history is doomed to repeat itself forever?
I've always thought that the more people manage money, the more risk there.
If the news is finally confirmed, I hope that this will become a turning point. No more third party handling the money of all. Everyone should be responsible for their money and their business.
I hope I'm just wrong..

added on "Specials" category
Critical Mass Hydrophonic growed added for sale!
Here a little bit of info from leafly.com
Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk 1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.

Thank you all for the interest in making the tutorial, I received several and I'm working to get them on the shop.
I take this opportunity to announce that I have just received another strain, formerly was the one that had more sales:
Skunk No. 1 (Hydrophonic)

(order quantity has to be larger than 5g).
about your order (quality, delivery time etc.) on 910 reddit and on 911 deepdotweb using the same username as here in the shop (please use 912 one of this templates to post on reddit).
opening a new ticket here in the shop.

of your favorite weed for free on your next order.
5. On your next order simply apply the coupon code (valid for 1 month)

Wanted editor to create a custom guide on how to buy bitcoins.
What is needed on guide? - It must be totally noob friendly, detailed step by step. (may be nice include some screenshots too, is just an idea) - Guide may be divided in 2 parts: 1- How to buy Bitcoins. 2- How to buy here with it. - Avoid copy/paste other tutorials. - Easy to be posted on site, don't make a PDF file
If you have some free time and correct spelling, there is a reward: 20g at your choice of any strain on sale free shipping.
Just open a ticket asking about :)
Thanks, ElHerbolario Posted on 917 07/03/2016 by 918 ElHerbolario
As tittle says! Also added glass jars pic of the stock on sale.
I'm proud to announce that site starts rolling again with new and amazing features that will simplify my life and makes your purchases simple, secure, always knowing status and in order to manage the possible questions or requests you may have.
And last, but not least thanks for all my patient customers that are waiting their orders or my email replies, I have replied a lot, but still remaining a lot more to reply.
Also thanks to all support messages received on multiple places.
Hi, I sign this message to prove my identity. (read this message entire to know how verify this)
First of all I would like to apologize to my clients for the lack of communication during the last 10 days. It has not been easy...believe me!
I know that the server has had several fails due to suspicious traffic, and ended disabled. Last weeks I have been receiving several extortion messages to restore service... Obviously I have not accepted to pay. I suspect what happened, but I will not accuse anyone, because I think removing the shit does not help, just stink more.
Now, obviously the site is being rebuilt from zero. It is now 3:11am on February 23, and hope to have the site 100% operational within 8 hours (yes, I will not be able to sleep now ...)
I appreciate all customers who have placed an order after the February 18, to contact me by email to: elherbolario@sigaint.org to check the status of your order (it will be difficult but not impossible, and fortunately I have a temporary registration which can be useful) I repeat again, contact to SIGAINT email. Lelantos are abandoned cause the DDOS attack happened some weeks ago.
I sign this message with my PGP key to prove my identity. You can verify the validity of the key in "Grams" in the following link: http: grams7enufi7jmdl /infodesk/vendor/0x3606DA418DA3DB32 Just copy entire message (like a pgp encrypted message) then paste in your PGP software and click on "verify" You will see that this message have been signed by ElHerbolario (elherbolario@lelantos.org) (if you change only one letter of this message, verification fails)
To finish this message, I would just like to add two things:
