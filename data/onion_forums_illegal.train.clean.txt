LiberTORian 9 will be available soon. Featured articles on Negativland and Agenda 2030 Here is an excerpt: Devo was mentioned in the last issue of LiberTORian, but now the band got in the news. It looks like the lead singer and synthesizer player, Mark Mothersbaugh, held a wedding on the anniversary of 9/11. So here's the the deal: They decided to have a wedding cake in the form of the twin towers, and had the guests cut into it with box cutter blade. Post truncated. Click Reply to view.

" No1Again 15/10/06(Tue)09:19:39 55 No. 56 18 Just to point out, this man killed 15 people in oregon shooting..but it was not his first time killing. He is a long time serial killer. The media refuses to tell us the entire truth..only bits and pieces. This man had been threatening to go on a rampage for over 3 weeks. If I were getting paid by the government...I would have probably made an effort to end this before it began...but it was not my battle to fight. Don't be fooled into believe that the government and media dont know about his personal web page...they just choose not to reveal this "sensitive" information...Well i say "FUCK THAT AND FUCK YOU" .

We Will End The Good Times For The Bad People Search! New Articles
Now that FH2 is down and out I have migrated over to this new webhost that's apparently being hosted on a raspberry pie computer. It seems to be a little bit slow bandwidth wise but other than that everything seems fine. I no longer have to worry about the 250mb data limit on hosting that FH2 had, although my sites fairly light so I probably didn't have to worry anyways. Oh well, as long as there is a free webhost on the darknet Heidenwut will have a home.

UPDATE 1: Listings are ready, but please check pics tomorrow 15th July. I make it better ones with daylight. Posted on 55 07/07/2016 by 56 ElHerbolario
Just I want to inform what will happen with weed prices for the next 2 months.
May you know (or not) that the summer time is very bad to grow indoors. Temperature is too high for a suitable grow conditions. Most growers already powered off his facilities some weeks ago.
I don't want to cause panic to customers, but if you plan to make some purchase, make it before prices raise.
To end this post with a good news, I want to remember that arround October, firsts outdoor harvest will be ready, with awesome tasty outdoor strains with unbeatable prices!
I just received this new Amnesia Haze batch, check it!
And honestly, you will not find better quality at a better price on DN!
Posted on 72 14/06/2016 by 73 ElHerbolario
I'm proud to show u the new site layout :)
Right now I'm working on backend to customize few things: Products display price in Euro / Bitcoin. Price rate updates each 10 mins. Improved customer panel. New notifications badges. Improved checkout page. Improved customer registration. Customer can check in his order history the amount and bitcoin adress of each order placed.
I expect to have it ready arround the second week of July. (Finally taken more work than expected)
Once website will be ready, will be placed into another .onion adress for a 4 weeks period. During this time both shops will be online, and customers can migrate easily.
Also Cannalope Haze restock next week. Already harvested some time ago, and currently drying.
During today (Thursday) I expect to get new strains and maybe also the Amnesia if are ready to sell.
Just look the pics speak itself!
Posted on 84 31/05/201631/05/2016 by 85 ElHerbolario
I'm pleased to share with you this new strain!
Is 100% BIO growed. Producer have made very nice job as you can see how well trimmed is!
This strain is very good by his uplifting effects and by happiness that produces and his medical effects are good for stress.
You should try it before I run out of stock!
As tittle says! I think 7EUR/g is a fair price, so you can buy it until I get out of stock :)
This website will be deleted on 18th August. Please move to the new onion adress: elherbotsiddarol
