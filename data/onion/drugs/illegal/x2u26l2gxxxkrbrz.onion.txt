Frequently Asked Questions

   Q: Why not just use a market myself?
   A: Multiple reasons:
   1. Safety, we use peer-reviewed anonymous mail forwarding services when
   dealing with vendors. In the event that a vendor and or marketplace is
   compromised your mailing information is not.
   2. Security, we use multisig on all transactions even for marketplaces
   that do not have it implimented.
   3. We use trusted vendors with only the best ratings. We also
   pre-screen new Vendors and have minimum requirements in order to be a
   verified vendor.
   4. If an Item is verified undelivered (tracking shows undelivered), We
   will order a reship no questions asked. (Even if the vendor does not
   offer it, comes out of our Kool-Aid fund)
   5. We are nicer and faster to reply than alot of vendors.
   Q: Do you charge fees?
   A: We live on a mere 1% of the total on each transaction and donations.
   (this is to cover our operational costs such as mail forwarding,
   servers, and Grape Kool-Aid)
   Q: What if this site goes down or get seized?
   A: We have gone to some extreme lengths to mitigate any issues with
   seizure by Law Enforcement. However, things do happen. In that case we
   have Accounts registered in these following forums under the name
   "TheDrugStoreLives":___________________should there be any outage due
   to outside forces we will immedietly announce the new URL there and via
   our official Bitmessage account only
   "BM-2cTNzCe2tgqvZ6ietwyZAAUyHpzA2hVSXA"
   Q: What is an "anonymous mail forwarding service" and who do I use?
   A: Simply put, they accept packages on your behalf and reship them to a
   different name and address. We cannot suggest any due to professional
   courtesy. Duckduckgo.com is your friend. Be smart, read reviews.
   Q: What payment methods do you accept?
   A: We love Bitcoin, Litecoin, Darkcoin, and Dogecoin mainly.
   Q: How do I know you are not Law Enforcement?
   A: You dont. But would Law Enforcement encourage you to use an
   anonymous mail forwarding service when dealing with us? Doubtful.
   Q: What's with the Grape Kool-Aid?
   A: You don't understand addiction?

Our Mission

   We are dedicated to the idea of moving the drug trade away from shady
   and dangerous real world trades that so commonly come bundled with
   inferior quality. The online drug markets have been a vital step in
   accomplishing this task, however there are still flaws in the process.
   Our goal is to mitigate those flaws and provide an end to end service
   in a way that helps and rewards honest online vendors while at the same
   time allowing the end consumer to remain as safe and anonymous as
   possible while recieving the best quality imaginable.
   We accept most major crypto currencies!
   We believe in privacy. We offer anonymous mail forwarding service by
   DEFAULT so the vendor NEVER has your address in case of market/vendor
   seizure. WE ENCOURAGE the use of peer reviewed mail forwarding
   services. (Although we keep an extremely strict no logs no customer
   info policy the only way for you to be safe is for us not to have your
   real address either.)
   Due to the constant updating and fluctuation of of product listings and
   pricing we work on a simple request platform.
   Our team members work shifts 24/7 around the clock including holidays.
   Simply put, we do not stop. As soon as a request comes in we go to work
   searching all vendors and all markets in our verified list to find and
   quote you the best price. If you have a specific vendor you prefer,
   tell us and of course we will be happy to accommodate.
   The Drug Store is here to make life easy for you, we guarantee the
   simplest and safest online drug buying experience possible. In turn we
   charge a flat 1% fee to cover our operational costs and our Grape
   Kool-Aid addiction. (No we are not joking, it's really good)
   We believe in and practice "private transparency". We will answer ANY
   and ALL questions regarding our service (minus OPSEC) and are always
   welcome to the ideas of the community with open arms! Do you have some
   good ideas on how to improve the buying experience and or increase
   security? tell us HERE
   Are you ready for the best part? All transactions are done via MULTISIG
   by default. We don't like getting ripped off, neither should you!
   With Love,
   The TDS Team.
