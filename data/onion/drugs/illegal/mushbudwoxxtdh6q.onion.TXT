MUSHBUD ‚Äì Shipping


   10G sizes are sent as ‚ÄúMachine Sorted First Class Letter-Mail‚Äù (AKA
   Snail Mail).  These 10G Packs can take up to 30 Days to arrive, even
   for my domestic customers.  If you need an expedited delivery, you
   should purchase elsewhere.  The majority of my packages will arrive in
   the time frames I‚Äôve listed further down on this page.  I‚Äôm very
   serious that 25% of my packs will arrive late, it‚Äôs been this way since
   the start.

     If you are not prepared to wait up to a full 30 Days for delivery,
     please make your purchase elsewhere.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Orders with multiple package(s) will be shipped out (separately) at
   least 24-48 hours apart to stagger arrival dates both at the boarder
   and to your local address.  This is done for your safety, to reduce any
   suspicions from customs agents or your local post office.  This is why
   I do not combine ship.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I Ship World Wide!
     __________________________________________________________________

   I ship from Canada, but the majority of my orders are to people
   residing outside of Canada.  My #1 destination is to the USA, with the
   UK close behind.

   I sell many packs to Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland.  The
   Viking Countries are GOLDEN!

   At this point, I have shipped successfully to nearly every European
   Country!

   Russia & Eastern Europe have been good so far, but very slow often
   needing more then 30 days.

   Central & South America, (other then Brazil) all countries have been
   successful albeit very slow at times requiring 5 weeks in some cases.

   Asian sales have been low, but from what I have sent they have been
   successful.  Some popular destinations include  India, Japan, China and
   Thailand.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Shipping Times:
     __________________________________________________________________

   I do not offer expedited shipping.  All packages are sent first class
   letter-mail, and comply to strict ‚ÄúMachine Sorted‚Äù Letter mail
   standards.

   The package should not (in most cases) take more then 30 days to reach
   you. From past experience, I expect my shipping times to be (Business
   Days):

   Canada 5-7 Days | USA 7-12 Days | UK 7-12 Days | Europe 10-20 Days |
   AUS & NZ 10-20 Days | Russia 25-35 Days | Central & South America 20-30
   Days |

   In many cases, the package will take less then 10 business days to
   arrive. HOWEVER, I do not control the mail!.. In some cases (In some
   parts of the world) it may take up to 30 days to receive (Russia I‚Äôm
   looking at you).
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you are not prepared to wait a full 30 days (in worst case
   scenarios)‚Ä¶ then do not order from me please. 25% of my packs do arrive
   later then expected! (Even my domestic can arrive later then 10-12
   days).

   Please also allow the 24-48 Hours it will take to Process and ship your
   order.
     __________________________________________________________________

     Orders placed on Friday/Saturday/Sunday will be processed and put in
     the mail Sunday night for pickup on Monday Afternoon. This is due to
     Canada Post being closed on Saturday & Sunday.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Country Warnings:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Israel & All Middle East & North
   Eastern African countries will be classified  ‚Äúbuy at your own risk‚Äù
   for any purchase of any size.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Australia & New Zealand.  Your combined purchasing power once made you
   #2 on my shipment destination list.  The hammer came down in 2014, and
   I was unable to reach higher then a 50/50 success rate with my 10G
   packs.

   Since that time I have created my new (30)G pack, which was designed
   Specifically with Aus & NZ in mind!  I have put a lot of effort in to
   this stealth, and I am now abiding to the ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù of Australian
   Officials inspecting these new packs.  I have shipped several dozen of
   these new (30)G packs to Aus & NZ all with 100% success.  You can now
   buy with confidence!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Israel.  We once had a good relationship you and I! Your sales higher
   then even my own domestic.  I was told that your postal security had
   increased in late 2013, your government began inspecting all mail for
   terrorist activity.  Buy at your own risk!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Brazil.  You were once my busiest South American destination, until a
   rash of reports from customers claiming their (10)G packages were not
   arriving.  I suspect though, that these claims were largely fraudulent‚Ä¶
   Perpetuated by a group of douche bags looking to profit on my (10)G
   guarantee.  Regardless, Brazil is now ‚ÄúBuy at Your Own Risk‚Äù.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì Stealth


   I have 2 forms of stealth.  One specifically for (10)G the other for
   (30)G and larger.
     __________________________________________________________________

   About the (10)G Stealth:

   The stealth is ULTRA SNEAKY.  It is disguised to look like any other
   mailing sent out a million times a day. The package does not shift
   weight when moved, does not produce strange sounds or smells. There
   will be -no- scent‚Ä¶ the contents will be bagged (Mylar laminate) &
   vacuum sealed! The package is plain and inconspicuous, no identifying
   marks or strange shapes. It is very small/thin and will fit in to any
   mailbox.

   Should the package be opened, it has been labeled and presented in a
   way to (hopefully) deceive a customs agent in to believing that it is
   something legal. So far it has done a very good job at that!
     __________________________________________________________________

   About the (30)G + Stealth:

   (30)G stealth is my best stealth. The package is naturally larger then
   (10)G as it contains 3x the content.  The extra size has allowed me to
   elaborate on the presentation.

   It now looks completely professional, exactly as you would expect a
   product to look as if it was purchased legally from a reputable online
   business.  Customs would need to send your package to a laboratory to
   know for certain that it was illegal.

   I have crafted this packaging technique, with extra attention to
   detail.  My goal was to produce a reliable stealth capable of passing
   Australia‚Äôs notoriously strict visual inspection.  So far it has been
   doing an excellent job!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Both stealth techniques will be professionally labeled, including a
   Return Address. This return address is FAKE, so be sure to double check
   your mailing address is correct in the PGP message you provide. This is
   your responsibility.  If the pack is returned to sender, there will be
   no getting it back!

     Do NOT try to contact me at the fake return address or the fake
     information included with the package!

   Not having a name on the package will raise suspicion, you must provide
   a name with your address. This name should be associated with the
   address!  Fake names on PO Boxes are more often then not returned to
   sender!  This seems to be a postal policy in many countries.

   My packs do not and will never require a signature. They will be
   delivered to your mailbox/slot with your bills & junk mail. Be sure not
   to throw it out by accident!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Precaution!

   Regardless of the quality of the stealth, suspicions can be raised at
   YOUR boarder when the arrival frequency is high.  If you are ordering
   too many packages too soon, eventually someone with authority will
   confiscate your packages, to err on the side of caution even if they
   can‚Äôt prove it illegal.

   I ship multiple package orders 24 hours apart to stagger arrival days.
   Even so, Several packages arriving from Canada in a short period of
   time will no doubt peak the attention of some Government official in
   your Country.  Use your discretion, and purchase only what you need‚Ä¶
   wait to purchase additional packages when they are needed.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì FAQ

    [15]Add comments

   Frequently Asked Questions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do I Register for your site? What will I need?

   You will only need a working email address, a password & user name of
   your choosing.

   Your email address must be a traditional top level domain. ie:
   .com/.net/.org (and the newer ones) it can not be a .onion

   The script will send a verification link to your email address, to
   ensure it is valid.  Please double check your email address is correct
   before clicking the submit button.

   When you receive the link, you should cut and paste it to your TOR
   Browser‚Ä¶  Clearnet services will not be able to resolve the .onion URL
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do I place an order?

   We will assume that you have already registered for the site, and have
   decided which of the products you‚Äôd like to purchase.

     You will need a couple things, primarily Bitcoin (BTC) and PGP
     Knowledge.

   I do not enforce PGP, personally I believe it‚Äôs up to you to decide the
   risk‚Ä¶ but understand there is risk! Learning and using PGP will make
   you feel much safer, but you may send your personal details
   unencrypted.

     TOR is encrypted end to end, so the chances of interception during
     transmission is very low.  However, if my site was ever seized or
     hacked, there may be traces of unencrypted details you do not want
     people to discover.  Using PGP will prevent this outcome.

   Have your Bitcoin ready, do not start the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù process until your
   Bitcoin is available and ready to send.  When you purchase Bitcoin, you
   should purchase a little more then you are expecting to spend, just to
   be sure as the price will fluctuate.

   Now lets assume you have Bitcoin and PGP.

   You can find my PGP key listed above from my main menu.  You will need
   to copy and paste that information (unedited) in to a blank .txt file
   (name it MUSHBUD).

   You can then ‚Äúimport‚Äù that MUSHBUD.txt file in to your PGP Program of
   choice.  I highly recommend GPA for linux / [16]Gpg4win for MS /
   [17]gpgtools.org for OSX

   You should now see my MUSHBUD name in your PGP software with the email
   address mushbud@tormail.org  This email is no longer in use ([18]why?)

   From inside your PGP program, open the ‚Äúclipboard‚Äù and write down your
   full name and mailing address. It should appear something like so:
     * FirstName LastName
     * 1234 Something St./Ave.
     * APT #1 (optional)
     * City State/Prov Zip/Postal
     * COUNTRY

   Now we can encrypt this message using my PGP Key.  You should see a
   button that says ‚Äúencrypt‚Äù, when clicked you should see the option to
   choose MUSHBUD.  Choosing MUSHBUD should bring up a confirmation
   screen, press accept and your message should now be encrypted. Cut (do
   not edit) the entire message and save to another blank .txt file.

   We can now proceed to the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù.

   Assuming your cart has been filled with the products you wish to
   purchase, press the checkout button.

   Under the column named billing details we see a box labeled ‚ÄúYour PGP
   Message‚Äù.  Copy and paste the PGP message we just created in to that
   box, or if you would prefer you could now type in to that box your full
   name and mailing address.

   Please select your country from the drop down list, and if not already
   selected for you click on the ‚ÄúPay with Bitcoin‚Äù option.

   If you have any additional details/comments you‚Äôd like to communicate
   about the order (or just to say hi!) type that in the order notes.

   Assuming you currently have java-script turned off, you will see a box
   named ‚Äúupdate totals‚Äù towards the bottom of your screen.  Please click
   that now.

   If you haven‚Äôt already clicked the Terms box, you will see a message to
   do so.  Click on the Terms link (it will open a new window) and please
   read and understand them (it is brief).  If you agree to the terms, now
   click this box.

   Prepare your BTC now, whether you have to login to a secure Web service
   or fire up your BTC program‚Ä¶ do that now.  Once you click the ‚Äúplace
   order‚Äù box you will have no more then 2 hours for the payment to be
   received and verified by the processor.  So be prepared to send
   immediately.

   Are you ready to order? Let‚Äôs assume you are and press the button! =)

   Did you press the button? Let‚Äôs assume that you did =P

   You will now see a screen with both the BTC amount, and the BTC address
   to send to.

     Your BTC amount needs to be EXACT.  Do not round up or down. Ensure
     that your transaction fee has already been calculated and added.
     The payment processor will check the receiving BTC address for the
     precise amount. Once it is seen on the block-chain the order will be
     completed.

   The software will move an order from ‚Äúpending‚Äù to ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù after 3
   confirmations on the Blockchain.

   That‚Äôs it!  You should (in most cases) receive a confirmation email
   that your payment was received followed up with a confirmation once
   your shipment has been physically put in the mail box.  That means
   exactly that, I‚Äôve gone out and put the pack in the box.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -What dosages do you recommend?

   I cover that question in detail, in this [19]article.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do you recommend I consume your powdered mushrooms?

   I cover that question in detail, in this [20]article.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do I store these shrooms, how long will they last?

   Storing your shrooms has now been made easier.  You can keep the
   shrooms in the packaging they arrive in.  An air tight seal, while
   being kept in a cold/cool & dark place, your opened package could last
   up to a year and maybe longer.

   Humidity, Heat, Air and Light are enemies to your shrooms.  Prevent
   these by placing your package in to the freezer and they may last
   several years.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -Do your shrooms come in capsules (gel caps)?

   They do not (for stealth reasons).  The powder is fine enough that you
   could use them with your own gel cap machine.  You can often find the
   machine on sale for around $25.  Do a Google search for ‚Äúcap-m-quik‚Äù,
   the standard for inexpensive homemade capsules.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -Do you accept Privnote instead of PGP?

   No I do not.  The reason is that Privnote requires that I enable
   java-script in order to read the message.  This is a dangerous thing
   for Vendors.  I would suggest using this service instead:

   Feel free to ask a question in this comment section, but please make it
   a question worthy of the FAQ.  Simple questions such as ‚Äúwhen will xXx
   be back in stock?‚Äù belong in the forum [22]Help Desk!

       signed up to protonmail etc.
       Where you say:
       From inside your PGP program, open the ‚Äúclipboard‚Äù and write down
       your full name and mailing address. It should appear something like
       so:
       FirstName LastName
       1234 Something St./Ave.
       APT #1 (optional)
       City State/Prov Zip/Postal
       COUNTRY
       Now we can encrypt this message using my PGP Key. You should see a
       button that says ‚Äúencrypt‚Äù, when clicked you should see the option
       to choose MUSHBUD. Choosing MUSHBUD should bring up a confirmation
       screen, press accept and your message should now be encrypted. Cut
       (do not edit) the entire message and save to another blank .txt
       file.
       Where do I find the clipboard. How do I open it from within GPG?
       Sorry‚Ä¶I ma a newbiem

            I‚Äôve not used the Mac OSX version myself, but the GPA Linux
            and Win version are practically identical. I will have to
            assume the Mac version is pretty close in design.
            In the Linux/Win version, when you launch the GPA program, it
            opens to an interface that has several icons.
            One of those Icons is the clipboard. You can hover your mouse
            over each icon, and a description will appear.
            Please let me know if that helps, if not I can take a closer
            look at the Mac version, there should be a youtube video
            available to watch that will walk you through the interface.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì Policy


   I offer 2 products essentially.  My original (10)G Stealth, and my
   newer (30)G+ Stealth. (30)G+ Stealth has no guarantee of safe arrival,
   however the (10)G does to an extent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I will no longer guarantee more then 1 open Transaction of a quantity
   of (1) 10G Pack.  ‚ÄúTransaction‚Äù = The entire process, from your order
   to -in your hands- delivery.

   IE: The ideal Transaction would be that: the customer orders 1 (10)G,
   and then waits for that order to arrive, and then if they wish, they
   order another.

   This would make your ‚Äúopen‚Äù transaction a Finished or Closed
   transaction.  I will continue to guarantee those (10)G transactions
   100%

   If you are impatient and decide to order a pack every 24 hours: Then
   you have created several ‚ÄúOpen Transactions‚Äù of which I will only
   guarantee (1).

   If you order multiple (10)G packs all at once, and they are all seized‚Ä¶
   i will only guarantee 1 of those packs.

   If your packs are seized from the suspicion generated due to the extra
   traffic you‚Äôve created for your address, why would you expect me to be
   liable for your action?

   I refuse to be, so use your discretion and accept this risk on to
   yourself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   (30)G+ has been from it‚Äôs time of introduction a ‚Äúbuy at your own risk‚Äù
   purchase.

   In my previous markets (mainly SR2 & Agora) I would have the customer
   send me a confirmation PM that would have him/her indicate that they
   understood the risk was their own.  I now have a check box for terms on
   the order page.

   I have put my very best effort in to the (30)G+ stealth, it is very
   effective and so far has nearly 100% success.

   I can‚Äôt honestly say full 100%, to clarify the situation.  I have had 1
   customer who did not receive their pack after they had several packs a
   week sent to the same address in Africa over the course of 5 weeks.

   The frequency of identical shipments arriving to the same address over
   weeks will no doubt raise suspicions at your post office, especially if
   it‚Äôs a post office that does not ordinarily receive mail from Canada
   (or the western world).

   I caution people not to do this, please order what you need. 1 per week
   is acceptable for larger/populated Westernized Countries.

   I will not limit you as this is a customer‚Äôs ‚Äúacceptable risk‚Äù
   decision‚Ä¶  but understand this is one of the reasons why I will not
   guarantee these larger sizes.

   used the Mac OSX version myself, but the GPA Linux and Win version are
   practically identical. I will have to assume the Mac version is pretty
   close in design. In the Linux/Win version, when you launch the GPA
   program, it opens to an interface that has several icons. One of those
   Icons is the clipboard. You can hover your mouse over each icon, and a
   description will appear. Please let me know if that helps, if not I can
   take a closer look at the Mac version, there should be a youtube video
   available to watch that will walk you through the interface.

   that many of my older customers will use to verify that this is in fact
   the same MUSHBUD that they have been doing business with over the

   to inform themselves, and upgrade to the new key if that makes hem feel
   more secure. Like I mentioned on the page, I leave the choice up to
   them which in my mind is better then being told what to do. Ty for your

       [22]MUSHBUD
       Keymaster
       This post is to inform my customers that I have now begun to sell
       my 10G offering at the HANSA Market that you can visit at this URL:
       [23]http://hansamkt2rr6nfg3.onion/
       I am selling (of course) as MUSHBUD
       You can purchase my 10G PE from HANSA with Full Escrow. Search
       MUSHBUD inside HANSA to quickly find me.
       HANSA is a modern market using multisig BTC to help prevent
       Marketplace exit scams. It has a wonderful layout with fast speeds.
       It really should be the #1 market in my mind, but people cling to
       what they are familiar with at Alpha bay.
       I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until people make the switch to

MUSHBUD ‚Äì Products


   What am I selling?

   I sell a special strain of Psilocybe Cubensis named ‚ÄúPenis Envy‚Äù which
   is known in short as (PE). I sell no other strain.  This is a potent
   strain, and with a little research on Google & Reddit, you will find a
   lot of user feedback attesting to it‚Äôs strength.

   I sell a Ground & Prepackaged product.  Currently I offer sizes of
   10/30/60 grams.  I do not offer custom order sizes.  The product is
   ground in to fine powder to conceal it‚Äôs identity, and to produce a
   convincing stealth that must meet strict letter mail dimension‚Ä¶ which
   in turn ensures a very high success rate to nearly every country on the
   planet!
     __________________________________________________________________

     My Shrooms are quality and potent. 100% pure home grown. There is no
     chance of wild mushroom contamination.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì About


   I am the same MUSHBUD that had been servicing the DNM Scene since the
   original Silk Road, as well as SR2, Sheep, BMR, Agora & briefly at
   Abraxas.

   You can verify my PGP  (as well as read hundreds of my positive
   reviews) at GRAMS info Desk.  GRAMS is an independent resource created
   as a contact and verification point of Hundreds of Vendors across
   Dozens of DN Markets.

   [14]http://grams7enuazq4uxl.onion/infodesk/vendor/0xFE2A9F499FE544AB

   Registering with GRAMS will allow you to contact me with their internal
   mail system, as well as use their reliable Bitcoin mixing service.

   I am the same MUSHBUD who has frequented Reddit.com for the past 3+
   years.  I have created my own Sub Reddit which you can now reach at the
   following URL:

   [15]http://redditmoongroogs.onion/r/MUSHBUD/

   Doing a search for ‚ÄúMUSHBUD‚Äù on Reddit.com, will provide new customers
   with an even more comprehensive list of reviews spanning the life of
   several market places.

   I am the same MUSHBUD on TMG, you can visit my  [16]Vendor Post |
   [17]Review Post.

   I am the same MUSHBUD on THE HUB.  You can view my [18]Official HUB
   Review Thread.

   I am the same MUSHBUD who has been doing private sales via email.  The
   emails I currently use are:
    1. mushbud@protonmail.com (Primary).
    2. mushbud@lelantos.org ‚Äì (Backup) Use this as a last resort.  They
       are not very reliable and I do not check it frequently.
    3. mushbud@sigaint.org (This email is currently offline, the
       sigaint.org service is apparently out of business.  DO NOT send
       email to this address.)

     The email used in my PGP Key (mushbud@tormail.org) is no longer
     under my control as it was seized by the FBI during the ‚Äúfreedom
     hosting‚Äù Raid in 2013.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ANYTHING! be back in stock.† So I am going to use this Blog area to
   update my customers as to what&#8217;s happening behind the scenes with
   my grow.<span id="more-691"></span></p> <p>September&#8217;s grow has
   finished all it&#8217;s flushes, it&#8217;s been dried, ground and
   packaged completely as 10G.† It&#8217;s up for sale now.</p>
   <p>Currently, I am waiting on the bulk of my material to finish a full
   colonization which I expect to take place around OCT 20.</p> <p>I will
   introduce that material to fruiting conditions at about the same time,
   expecting most of it to be prepared and put to fruiting by OCT 23.</p>
   <p>Pins will take about 8-10 Days to appear&#8230; those pins will take
   another 8-10 Days to fully mature and ready for harvest.</p> <p>After
   drying/grinding/packaging we&#8217;re looking at Nov 10+/- before it
   becomes available.† I will convert the entirety of this next harvest to
   60G.</p> <p>I do have some material I started fruiting last week.† Not
   nearly as much as I&#8217;m expecting for Nov, but enough to create a
   couple dozen 30G.† I expect I&#8217;ll be putting those on sale for
   people towards the end of this month or the first week of Nov.</p>
   <p>For those who desire 60G, you may choose to pass on purchasing x2
   30G&#8230; and instead wait the extra week for a 60G.† There should be
   plenty!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

   come as powder for stealth primarily, but this has made things more
   convenient/advantageous for the customer in several ways.† I will
   discuss my favorite ingestion methods, and some of the perks of
   grinding your mushrooms to powder.<span id="more-220"></span></p>
   <p>Powdered shroomies can be easier to ingest, with less gag reflex (if
   done correctly, more on that later in this article).† Being pleasant to
   ingest helps smooth you in to &#8220;the groove&#8221;, rather then
   grimacing over taste and texture of a dried version, of something many
   people already pick off of their dinner plate!</p>
   <blockquote><p><em><strong>This &#8220;Yuck&#8221; factor is often what
   creates a queasy feeling that can result in over reaction, and
   vomiting.</strong></em></p></blockquote> <p>It&#8217;s a belief that
   grinding shrooms to powder helps to increase the digestible
   &#8220;Surface Area&#8221;, essentially increasing the available
   particulate in your system, allowing for more of the
   &#8220;actives&#8221; to reach the bloodstream during digestion&#8230;
   and possibly resulting in a stronger trip.</p> <p>Mushrooms are known
   to be hard to digest when raw.† They are made of Chitin, a
   polysaccharide and essentially the same substance that insect and
   shellfish exoskeletons are constructed of.† If you wolf down large
   pieces of psychedelic mushroom, to avoid the taste and texture&#8230;
   you may not be getting your money&#8217;s worth.</p> <p>Grinding to
   powder helps with the digestion, it helps masquerade the taste and
   texture and allows you these three most popular ingestion methods
   (ordered by my preference).</p> <ol> <li>LemonTek</li>
   <li>Capsules</li> <li>Tea</li> </ol> <p><strong>LemonTek</strong> is my
   #1 recommendation.† Before I explain it&#8217;s preparation (which is
   very simple), let&#8217;s cover what it is &#8220;suppose&#8221; to be
   doing.</p> <p>It is believed that the acid in your lemon juice is
   pre-converting the psilocybin in to <span
   class="rendered_qtext">psilocin</span>.† This helps to expedite the on
   set of the trip, regardless of of whether the effects are illusion or
   not&#8230; there is a feeling of a <em>harder hitting rush</em> and
   increased potency.</p> <p>On top of this benefit is the incredible
   &#8220;masking&#8221; ability of the sour/tart in your lemon juice.† It
   quite easily masks the taste of your shrooms, and converts the dried
   powder in to a slurry which is much easier to swallow.</p>
   <p><em><strong>Preparation is easy and will take 25 minutes or
   less:</strong></em></p> <p>You will need a couple fresh lemons, or you
   could substitute with authentic fresh squeezed lemon juice such as the
   kind found in those plastic squeeze lemons (I believe there is also a
   bottled BBQ/Marinade version).† Limes will probably work equally as
   well.† Any citrus fruit <em>may</em> work, but I don&#8217;t have
   personal experience (a sour grapefruit comes to mind).</p> <p>A small
   glass (shot-glass is good) and 1 glass water/fruit juice as a
   chaser.</p> <p>Measure out the shroom dose you&#8217;re planning to
   take, and put that in your empty glass.† When adding liquid we want to
   create at first a paste, followed by a sludge and finally a slurry
   stirring between each.</p> <p><em>Squeezing your lemons before hand
   will be helpful.† It helps if your lemons or juice are at room
   temp.</em></p> <p>Slowly begin to add juice to the powder until it
   looks (just ever so barely) absorbed.† Give it a little stir.† Add a
   little more juice and it should become a liqduidy glob.† Give it another
   stir.† Finish up with as much juice as you desire (remember you&#8217;ll
   be drinking this!)</p> <p>At this point, if the sour/tart nature of
   lemons is unappealing to your buds, you could add a spoon full of honey
   or sugar (stir until dissolved).</p> <p>Let the concoction sit for
   10-20 minutes (not much longer).</p> <p>Knock back your creation (sip
   if you prefer), and wash down with the chaser you had on hand.</p>
   <blockquote><p>Please consume the remnants, any particles that remain
   in your glass will contain actives.† Disposing of them will be wasteful.†
   Swirl a little water in the glass to get the
   remainder.</p></blockquote> <p>Done! I do add a bit of sugar to my mix,
   and I find it pleasant enough.† It has a slightly <em>off</em> tasting
   lemon aid flavor, that doesn&#8217;t repulse me in the least.</p>
   <p>For me, LemonTek helps rush me through some of the
   &#8220;noise&#8221; and provides me a cleaner/clearer feeling.</p>
   <p><strong>Capsules (Gel Caps) </strong>area a trusty stand by for
   people with nausea problems.† They could still produce a gag reflex with
   people who find swallowing larger pills a difficulty.† Typically size 00
   and 000 gel caps are used for mushies (and they are pretty big).</p>
   <p>You can purchase a capsule making device at an affordable
   price&#8230; searching úcap-m-quikù on google will lead you to many
   sources.† You will want one that includes the TAMPER accessory.</p>
   <p>This isn&#8217;t a particularly convenient way to consume
   considering the effort involved in their creation.</p> <p>It may be
   necessary</p> <ul> <li>If you are reselling, most people will not want
   powder in a bag.</li> <li>For travel convenience (put them inside a
   vitamin container labeled as a herbal remedy).</li> <li>For smuggling
   in to events, they can be hidden easily, and not easily identified
   (they could be your diet aid/ lactose agent etc)</li> <li>The capsules
   offer a fairly decent air seal, and provide longevity outside of the
   original shipping container&#8230; this may be your best option to have
   your shrooms &#8220;out and about&#8221; with you.</li> </ul> <p>When
   consuming capsules, it&#8217;s important they are taken on an empty
   stomach.† Having a full belly is going to severely effect your trip.† ( I
   discuss this a bit further down).</p> <p><strong>Tea
   Preparation,</strong> I am not a big fan and do not recommend this to
   anyone who would like to &#8220;Trip Balls&#8221; (as it were).† This
   technique is most often used to feel the &#8220;mellow&#8221; highs of
   mushrooms.† It is definitely the most pleasant way to consume your
   shroomies, and I would be surprised to hear reports of any nausea.</p>
   <p>If gag reflex/nausea are preventing you from trying mushrooms, then
   Tea is the choice you should make.</p> <p><strong>It is a very straight
   forward process with a couple caveats.</strong></p> <p>You will need a
   small pot with lid, a fine strainer, a cup/mug and your favorite flavor
   teabag.</p> <p>Measure out your dose.† For the beginner I recommend
   750mg (this will be a very light trip).† For the experienced user, I
   suggest more then you would typically take as a whole mushroom&#8230;
   ie your dose +250mg (maybe +350mg).† This is with the assumption you
   will dispose of the mushroom grounds rather then eat them.</p> <p>Fill
   your cup/mug to the brim with water and add to the pot, put the lid on
   the pot and bring to boil.† Once at rapid boil remove from heat, add the
   mushrooms and stir until settled.† Add your teabag, place lid back on
   and steep for 5-10 minutes.</p> <p>Stir and pour through strainer, push
   out any extra liquid in your teabag &amp; mushroom grounds by pushing
   down on the teabag as it lays on the mushroom grounds inside the
   strainer.</p> <p>Add milk and sugar to your liking</p> <p>Done!† Tastes
   good.† Just to be certain, use a tea that&#8217;s not too delicate in
   flavor.</p> <p>Psilocybin/P<span class="rendered_qtext">silocin</span>
   are delicate crystals, we don&#8217;t want to boil the hell out of
   them!† We don&#8217;t want any excessive oxidization (if we can help it)
   and there usually is to a degree some loss of potency.</p> <p>You will
   not acquire all &#8220;actives&#8221; with this method, some will be
   left behind and disposed of.† Experimentation will be required to find
   your sweet spot.† You will likely need to use more product then if
   consumed by an alternative method such as LemonTek.</p>
   <p><strong>Other Methods </strong>I absolutely do not support methods
   like &#8220;peanut butter sandwich&#8221; and &#8220;Chocolate
   milkshake&#8221; etc.† It is <strong>very </strong>important that if you
   intend to reach the &#8220;Tripping Balls&#8221; levels, that you
   follow proper fasting and empty stomach protocol.</p> <p>Sure you could
   reach &#8220;tripping balls&#8221; by wolfing down 4grams after Sunday
   dinner, but why do that when 2 grams will do the same on an empty
   stomach?</p> <p><strong>Proper Fasting Protocols.</strong></p> <p>Any
   experienced Mushroom head will recommend the same. It is just fact that
   a clean digestive system, free of any recent meals and restricted
   liquid allowance&#8230; will produce a trip and experience far greater
   then one where the protocols are neglected.</p> <p>You should use 3+
   hours without food, as a very basic suggestion. 12+ hours would be a
   better place for people to start when doing spiritual work.† Lets not
   forget that our shaman forefathers often fasted for up to a week on
   water alone before their ritualistic use.</p> <p>If you wish to reach
   their plane(s) of existence, you will need to follow their rules.†
   Shamans offer themselves up as vessels to the spirit realm, to be
   possessed by and experienced through the use of a catalyst.</p> <p>It
   is a real thing, it is happening everywhere and always.</p> <p>Some
   people will not want these visitations.† Often when things get to moody,
   to dark and feel like they are getting out of hand&#8230; you may want
   to begin eating.</p> <blockquote><p>I have found in this circumstance
   that drinking milk helps bring me back to ease.† This is a reason why I
   do not suggest using Milk or Dairy products to begin your trip.† To me
   it seems counter intuitive, as much as tripping on a full
   stomach.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Other Protocols.</strong></p>
   <p>Equally as important to your physiological preparations, are your
   environmental and psychological preparations.</p> <p>Some people
   <em>looove</em> to &#8220;fear and loath&#8221; trip, any place any
   time&#8230; life is a party! The weirder the better, &#8220;where the
   freaks at?&#8221; .† If this does not appeal to you, then you should
   remove yourself from the company of these trippers.† They will be
   tripping Darkness.† I&#8217;ve been there myself.† It is exciting, but
   when it goes dark it can be overwhelming&#8230; approaching
   terrifying&#8230; So many flashbacks <img

   class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p> <p>If
   you find enlightenment more appealing, mushrooms can sing your song
   every time by removing these vexation before hand.† Be at a calm and
   meditative state hours previous to consuming your dose.† Do not burden
   your high mind with thoughts of &#8220;things you must do&#8221;. Take
   the rest of the day off specifically to trip.</p> <p>Ensure that you
   are in a place that no one can just &#8220;pop by&#8221; and interrupt
   your trip.† Make the people you must coexist with aware that you are on
   mushrooms and have begun to trip.† Full disclosure feels good if you can
   afford to&#8230;</p> <p>It is good to focus your train of thought on
   something positive.† If you are at home, surround yourself with trigger
   objects that reflect your happy memories.† If you are a music fan, I
   suggest something instrumental without too many lyrical layers&#8230;
   unless of course you wish a more intimate relationship with your
   favorite artists.</p> <p>Nothing feels better then a secure spot,
   outside on a warm summers evening.† Under the stars with the sounds of
   small animals scurrying, the wind wafting sweet smells of plant
   life&#8230; it&#8217;s almost as if we were born to a planet
   earth&#8230; and not to a diabolical economic war machine† hell bent on
   destruction and total control.</p> <p>I hope you find this writing
   helpful and informative!† Please feel free to ask your questions in the
   comments below&#8230; and by all means please enlighten us with your
   own recommendations&#8230; This is how we grow!</p>

   less of PE then you would a typical shroom sold on the street, at least
   for your first time. It&#8217;s important to get a feel for them,
   before you go on an all out vision quest.</p> <p>People&#8217;s
   tolerances can vary widely. The following is recommendation based off
   of my own use, and discussions I&#8217;ve had with my customers over
   the years.</p> <p><strong>DOSAGE:</strong><span
   id="more-183"></span></p> <p><strong>.5</strong> <strong>Gram</strong>
   is a good euphoric dose, and is often the amount fitted inside a size
   00 Gel Capsule. This is a dose that lifts the mood&#8230; you can feel
   that you&#8217;ve taken something, but you could still easily go out,
   drink/dance and feel your spirits lifted. I don&#8217;t recommend going
   over this, and expecting to be fully functional in public.</p> <hr />
   <blockquote><p>The following doses are based on the expectation that
   you are following the protocols for good tripping as described in the
   &#8220;how to consume&#8221; guide. (my next project, I&#8217;ll post
   this soon).</p></blockquote> <hr /> <p><strong>1 Gram</strong> is where
   things become&#8230; mushroomy (is there really any other way to
   describe it? <img
   src="http://kpj3orlxmfs6yqah.onion/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-sm
   ile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height:
   1em;" /> ).† This is the dose I use to test my product. It gives you a
   run through the mushroom spectrum, without it completely overpowering
   your state of mind.</p> <p>It comes on in about 20-30 Minutes, reaching
   a peak at about an hour and half with a playful lingering that can last
   another 4-5 hours.</p> <p>My trips at 1G are usually pretty calm, I can
   go about my duties getting work done while listening to music.</p>
   <p>Colors become more vivid, tastes become tastier, music sounds
   splendid. Overall an enjoyable experience.</p> <p>I rarely feel any
   dark energy at 1G, you can expect yourself to function mostly
   normally.</p> <p>I wouldn&#8217;t try and do this dose at work and
   expect to get away with it&#8230; but a walk downtown, visit the art
   gallery, sunning at the beach, watching a movie&#8230; This is a good
   dose to liven up those activities, and possibly feel a profound insight
   from the experiences you are having.</p> <p>Scaling up from 1G should
   be tailored to your own chemistry, perhaps 1.5G is what you need to
   feel as I do on 1G.†† 2G opens up new doors/higher levels.</p> <hr />
   <p><strong>2 Grams</strong>, and you can begin to sense the presence of
   Divinity. It&#8217;s a mixed bag dose&#8230; I have often enough sailed
   through a 2 Gram dose without much in the way of new experience, but
   always a feeling of pleasure or profound importance.</p> <p>Time will
   begin to morph at this dose. <em>Gaps in time / spaciness</em> will
   emerge while you try and concentrate/focus . For a new user, this is
   where things could become dark.</p> <p>When you hear the phrase
   &#8220;let yourself go&#8221;, this is the mind space being talked
   about. It is better to learn to work with this energy, then it is to
   fight against it.† Inflicting your will on the trip, can make things go
   sideways.† Be with the trip not against it.</p> <p>Keep yourself calm,
   if you need to rationalize, remember that you have only just consumed
   the safest psychedelic on the planet, and the trip will eventually
   end.</p> <p>Nervous energies can form, while you &#8220;experience
   yourself experiencing mushrooms&#8221; (maybe for the first time) This
   is often where people may react badly to their shrooms.† Sensing this
   shift in consciousness&#8230; they feel overpowered.</p>
   <blockquote><p>An animalistic impulse is to purge the contents of the
   stomach in the hopes to feel better. If need be, provide yourself that
   relief&#8230; but remember your crazy shamanistic ancestry and how this
   would be frowned on! Be brave <img

   /></p></blockquote> <p><em>After some experience, a 2 Gram dose will
   likely become your &#8220;go to&#8221; dose.</em></p> <p>2G almost
   always for me starts out <strong>CHAOTIC</strong>, I sense myself
   sending and receiving information through dimensional portals. I can
   close my eyes, and meditate on colors that come to life, and exhibit a
   will of their own. When you work through your dark energy you will
   begin to approach something I can only call
   <strong>&#8220;Glow&#8221;</strong>.</p> <p>Glow for me, is an
   overwhelming sense of well being.† It&#8217;s like poetry in motion,
   it&#8217;s the spark of creativity&#8230; it is the first feelings of
   understanding.† It is when the world begins to intuitively make sense,
   without the need for words and with perfect realization&#8230;
   I&#8217;m always looking for Glow! =) it is a treat for the brave!</p>
   <p>That being said, often glow comes only to those willing for the
   &#8220;Heroic Dose&#8221; as Terance Mckenna would phrase it. (an
   excellent man that you should all know!)</p> <hr /> <p><strong>3.5
   Grams</strong> (a Heroic Dose) Is a popular dose in the Mushroom world.
   It&#8217;s been a standby dose you can recommend to anyone, knowing
   that&#8230; ok it might be a bit much for them, but we all know
   they&#8217;ll survive (provided they don&#8217;t lose their mind to
   fear, or maybe injure themselves from a lack of fear.† No jumping off of
   roofs believing you can fly please!).</p> <blockquote><p>3.5G is
   <strong>more then safe</strong> chemically speaking, but this begins a
   dose size that could have you &#8220;lose yourself&#8221; for a
   spell.</p></blockquote> <p>People who recommend you do mushrooms, want
   you to understand the &#8220;depth&#8221; of the experience. The
   previous doses recommended, may not provide that depth. This is why so
   many will recommend 3.5G, so that you <em>&#8220;get there&#8221;</em>
   and know it for what it is.</p> <p>Ego Deaths have and will continue
   for some at this level. Personally I have not had Ego Death at 3.5G,
   but I know many that have. I have a few tails told of Stomach Pumps at
   the hospital at 3.5G. This is why I recommend you know PE, don&#8217;t
   be to big and mighty!</p> <blockquote><p>Mushrooms have never really
   been a &#8220;party drug&#8221; and they should never be considered
   that at this high a dose.</p></blockquote> <p>3.5G and above, you
   really should be meditating in a tranquil spot, with no expectations to
   be any good to anyone, and if you&#8217;re inexperienced you should be
   with someone (who is not on anything), watching over you.</p>
   <p><strong>There will be Chaos</strong>! There will be alien artifacts
   &amp; visitation through unseen portals! you will not have a choice in
   the matter.</p> <p><strong>Mushrooms will own you for the next 4-8
   hours</strong>. You will be subject to what the mushrooms want to show
   you, not what you want to show mushrooms.† Absolutely do not attempt to
   drive or do anything that puts others in danger!</p> <p>This dose will
   drag you through the dirt, until you learn to behave! If you are trying
   to stand up raging, howling mad cursing your enemies! You will have a
   bad time man! sit back down.</p> <p>3.5G is going to learn you, (real
   quick) that the only way to enlightenment is through peaceful
   cohabitation with the other energies.</p> <p>The Chaos of Life/Death,
   Up/Down, Left/Right, On/Off right/wrong yin/yang&#8230; decisions, the
   perception of time will spin faster and faster and faster until it
   finally shatters in to a <strong>sweet unconscious release of
   divinity</strong>.</p> <blockquote><p>This is ego death&#8230; and this
   is subject to personal interpretation&#8230; and this is why we
   invented conversation. (both consciously and
   subconsciously)</p></blockquote> <p>It can be scary first time, and the
   more you learn to let go, the sweeter the final reward&#8230; after you
   climb the mountain, there is the kindest most loving glow imaginable
   that walks you down the path and back to earth.† Do not take your earth
   mother for granted!</p> <p>It has never betrayed me! On my
   roughest/wildest adventures, it has always carried me home. These truly
   are spirit molecules, and the language of Gods!</p> <hr /> <p><strong>5
   Grams</strong> is my Ego Death dose. It can go one of two ways for me
   at this dose, &#8220;really good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221;. (but not
   so much really bad anymore, I&#8217;ve learned to talk myself down)</p>
   <p>If good, it&#8217;s an indescribable feeling of wave after wave
   breaking against the shoreline of self. You can feel suddenly lifted
   from body, and transported to the astral realms. I often detect myself
   communicating with loved ones I&#8217;ve lost, picturesque settings
   will form from light acting as if molecules re arranged for my own
   experience.† You feel compelled to <strong>BEHOLD!</strong></p>
   <p><em>If it goes bad</em>, if I were to Video Record myself at this
   dose, you would see a wild monstrosity, squirming and writhing on the
   floor (on the floor because there&#8217;s no way I could stand or even
   sit up)</p> <p>I&#8217;m usually on my knees begging for forgiveness
   for what I&#8217;ve just begun.† I feel The Mighty Hammer of judgment
   striking my skull until it finally cracks, and I ooze on to the
   carpet&#8230; and the ooze is good <img

   eternity.</p> <p>It is an oooh so uncomfortable feeling &#8220;for
   me&#8221; this high, to go bad&#8230; but the absolutely mind boggling
   nature of all things existing at once becomes so clear.† There is
   knowledge and character strengthening even in the worst of trips.† What
   doesn&#8217;t kill you makes your stronger (or insane) <img

   my bad trips, I can feel a kind of &#8220;trickery&#8221; taking place.†
   I feel attempts being made by less then friendly entities trying to
   coerce my subconscious into believing lies&#8230; it&#8217;s still
   uncertain to me their function in nature.</p> <p>If you seek balance,
   you will receive balance.† If you seek good you will find good.† If you
   seek evil, you will find evil. positivity for positivity / negativity
   for negativity.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t do doses this high any more, they
   were a novelty at first, but now I am content to reach glow&#8230;

   really should know what you are doing!</p> <hr /> <p>I&#8217;d love to
