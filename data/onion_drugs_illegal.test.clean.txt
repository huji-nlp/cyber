Now cut a little of each end off to make it look nicer due to the tube telescoping. It may seem hard to roll the tubes at first but with some practice you can do a lot in a short amount of time. I can probably make about 100 tubes in 30 min or less.
I wouldn't store this starting fire mix without the addition of some boric acid to keep the potassium nitrate from reacting with the aluminum.
Potassium nitrate can be obtained from many sources. I personally buy it from Lowes hardware store as Green Light stump remover. It is sold for about $4.00 a pound. Other stump removers work too but not all of them are potassium nitrate so be careful and read the labels. I found that Green Light is the best kind to get because it is already in powdered form and it is pretty pure.
And the last place I have seen this stuff at is in drug stores. You can usually ask for it over the counter in small quantities for a pretty steep price. This stuff is really pure but it will cost you a lot of money.
First get a toilet paper tube.
Cut a notch in one end of the tube and insert sticky match into the tube and runt he rest of it along the outside of the tube.
Fill the bottom half of the tube with black powder.
Now fold the cut portions of the tube over the stars and tape everything to secure it in place.
Acetone peroxide is extremely unstable; this cannot be stressed enough! Acetone peroxide is said to be more unstable than nitroglycerin! I would suggest making this explosive shortly before it is desired to use it as it is never wise to keep unstable primary explosives around too long. It can be stored rather safely under water for some time. If allowed to stand in the open it will vaporize after some weeks. If stored in a sealed container it may crystallize into the crevices of the cap, which could detonate from the friction of opening. Mixing with RDX, PETN, or picric acid will improve the stability of this explosive.

Sky rockets are great fun but are a little more complicated of a firework to make. You can't just ram the propellant in a case and make it fly; you have to have a core through it to give it the power it needs to fly.
Ok now to make some more tooling. Cut a bock of wood and get a 1/8 inch steel rod form the hardware store. Take the wood block and cut a line across the top with a saw to form a groove that the steel rod can fit in. now drill a 1/8 inch hole in the board in the groove about center of the board. Drill another 1/8-inch hole a few inches away from the hole you just made in the same groove as well. Now you have a block with a groove and two holes in the grooves. Put the 1/8 inch steel rod through the one hole so it sticks out the side without the groove about 4 inches. Bend the rod so it is flat on the groove and take it out of the hole and bend it again so it looks like a staple so the rod goes through the two holes with the rod protruding out on the side with no groove about 4 inches and the other hole is the rest of the rod protruding out on the same side. Now bend the side with the long rod sticking up down flat to the surface and cut it off so it is about 2 inches on the surface. Cut the other rod protruding up at 2.5 inches. This is your coring spindle and is used to make a core through he propellant so it burns all at once giving it power to fly.
Ok so now that you have your irock tumbleri you need something to grind with. For grinding black powder and rocket fuel I use marbles. You can use lead shot from the gun department or brass also works (you can cut up a brass rod from the hardware store to make milling media). Never use steel! Because steel balls can spark and that will equal a bad time for you if your grinding black powder or other flammable mixture. Also don't grind mixtures that are unstable or sensitive. NEVER GRIND FLASH POWDER!!!!!
Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) is sold at local hardware stores as a paint striper. I found pure MEK at Home Depot as a paint striper for about 5 dollars a liter. It says right on the canister "Methyl Ethyl Ketone - M.E.K."
For pyrotechnics you're going to want to have a good balance. I got an Ohaus triple beam balance off of ebay for about 20 dollars. This balance had weights missing so I ordered them from the company for another 15 dollars. This is a good deal considering if you buy an Ohaus balance from the manufacture new it'll cost you about a hundred bucks! Balances can be quite expensive but they are very necessary if you are serious about pyrotechnics. Other cheaper alternatives could be diet scales used for measuring food or postage scales for weighing packages. These are not very accurate devices though. If you have a powder scale for reloading shells then that will work great.
Heat the sulfuric acid to 60-80 degrees Celsius using a hot water bath or a hotplate. Now slowly add the acetyl salicylic acid and it may fizz a little. Once you add the acetyl salicylic acid to the sulfuric acid it will be a really dark color. Keep this mixture at 60-80 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes so the sulfuric acid converts the acetyl salicylic acid to phenol and then to phenol sulfate.
Now take the mixture off the heat and add the potassium nitrate SLOWLY! It will fizz and bubble a lot so add the potassium nitrate is small portions. It took me about 1 hour to add all of the potassium nitrate to the mix. If you add it too fast a red gas will form, this is NO2 and it is toxic. Make sure you do all this outside or in a fume hood.
After all the potassium nitrate is added cool the mix down to room temperature and then put it in an ice bath to cool it to 0-5 degrees Celsius. It will get really thick at this point.
A mortar is a device used to launch aerial shells or mines. It basically consists of a tube and a base. To make one you first need some PVC pipe. You can get PVC at any hardware store for pretty cheap. It comes in many different sizes. I made some 2-inch diameter mortars and some 3-inch diameter mortars so for this case I got 2 inch PVC and 3 inch PVC. Now go cut a piece of wood or board to make a base for the mortar. Cut the PVC pipe to a length you like, I use about 1-foot length mortars. Now glue the PVC pipe standing on the board to the board with something like liquid nails or liquid welder or some other strong glue. Let it dry and paint it if you want, now you have a finished mortar!
Or you can make black powder at home for a much cheaper price, probably about 1/6 of the cost. First get all your chemicals gathered up and weigh out each of them on a balance.
Note: Mixing the meal powder with water makes it burn much faster when dry because the potassium nitrate is water soluble and this allows it to get into the porous charcoal and will make a much faster burning powder.
Black Powder: The Blender Method
First weight out all you chemicals the same as above (using standard 75/15/10 ratios). I would advise all your chemicals be a fine powder but it is not absolutely necessary. The finer the chemicals the better the powder. Throw your powder in a blender and add some hot water and stir it with a spoon. It should look like a thick slush of black goo. Never runt the blender with dry powder! This could cause a spark and you'll have a bad day. Now runt he blender with the wet goo of black powder for 5 or so minutes then let it settle or stir it a little with a spoon. Now run the blender for another 5 minutes making sure you don't hear anything chopping around. Hopefully by now you have no chunks and your black powder is mixed well and smooth. Pour the black powder goo on to some waxed paper or plastic bowel and let it air dry for a few days. After it is dry just break it up or crush it to the size of grains of powder you want the same as the previous method.

Hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine , methenamine, or urintropine)
Hexamethylenetriperoxidediamine, or for short HMTD, is another peroxide explosive similar to acetone peroxide. It has slightly more power than acetone peroxide but it is just as sensitive. This compound is still very dangerous and sensitive so extreme caution should be used. HMTD is also reactive with metals and can explode so contact with metal should be avoided. The synthesis is still relatively easy but the chemicals required may be harder to come by than acetone peroxide.
Now slowly add the hexamine to the chilled hydrogen peroxide making sure you dissolve all the hexamine into the hydrogen peroxide.

Bitcoin prices do vary - when you order your MPA - transfer PS10 per gram and if it's about right, I'll send.
