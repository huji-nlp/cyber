Gold and Silver Rain:
Also note that there are many other flash powder mixtures out there but i feel that this is the safest and more powerful of the mixtures out there. This is the same mix used in commercial m80's and salutes.
Fist get a roll of duct tape and cut a piece of tape about 6 inches in length. Put down a piece of waxed paper and put the tape sticky side down on the waxed paper. Now roll the duct tape round a 1/8-inch dowel rod to form a tube with the sticky side outside and the smooth side inside. Now take another piece of tape about 1 inch in length and put it around the outside of the tube to cover up the sticky side. I like to use red duct tape here to make the firecrackers look red.
Ammonium nitrate has numerous applications as an oxidizer and is used extensively in explosives. It can be used as a nitrate in nitration processes or as an explosive when mixed with numerous other chemicals and compounds.
Ammonium nitrate can be purchased at the drug store or pharmacy section of your local store. It is sold as instant cold packs or instant cold compress. It is used for pain relief. When you buy the package make sure you can shake it and hear solid inside. If it is all liquid and no solid then the bag of water inside the package broke and your ammonium nitrate is useless. Now to get the ammonium nitrate carefully cut the outer bag open on the edge making sure not the break the smaller inner bag of water. Now just dump out the powdered ammonium nitrate into a zip lock plastic bag and store in a dry place. Ammonium nitrate is very hydroscopic and will pick up moisture from the air and rendering it useless so therefore make every effort to keep it dry. Also you will have to ball mill or use a coffee grinder to powder the prills of ammonium nitrate from the package.
Potassium nitrate can be obtained from many sources. I personally buy it from Lowes hardware store as Green Light stump remover. It is sold for about $4.00 a pound. Other stump removers work too but not all of them are potassium nitrate so be careful and read the labels. I found that Green Light is the best kind to get because it is already in powdered form and it is pretty pure.
I have also heard this chemical can be purchased as fertilizer and large bags from some agricultural stores. I personally have not seen any of this but if you find it it'll be a large supply for a cheap price.
A mine is a pyrotechnic device that throws stars directly out of a mortar. They are relatively simple to make and are great for a beginner. This tutorial covers canister mines, which look a little more professional, and function a little better than the bag mines.
Fold the cut portions of the tube over and tape everything in place.
Fill the top half of the tube with stars.
Acetone peroxide is extremely unstable; this cannot be stressed enough! Acetone peroxide is said to be more unstable than nitroglycerin! I would suggest making this explosive shortly before it is desired to use it as it is never wise to keep unstable primary explosives around too long. It can be stored rather safely under water for some time. If allowed to stand in the open it will vaporize after some weeks. If stored in a sealed container it may crystallize into the crevices of the cap, which could detonate from the friction of opening. Mixing with RDX, PETN, or picric acid will improve the stability of this explosive.
Now measure out 50ml of hydrochloric acid in a glass beaker and add it to the acetone/peroxide mix slowly drop by drop keeping the temperature of the mix around 5-10 degrees Celsius. If the temperature raises above 10 degrees Celsius then stop adding the acid until it drops below 10 degrees then continue adding the acid. It is very important that you moderate the reaction; high temperatures will lower your yield and cause the formation of the less useful dicyclo isomer. After you add all the acid continue stirring for 5 minutes. Now either keep this mix in the ice bath for 24 hours or place the mix in a refrigerator for 24 hours. A white precipitant will form.
The depth gauge for the nozzel.
Ok now to make some more tooling. Cut a bock of wood and get a 1/8 inch steel rod form the hardware store. Take the wood block and cut a line across the top with a saw to form a groove that the steel rod can fit in. now drill a 1/8 inch hole in the board in the groove about center of the board. Drill another 1/8-inch hole a few inches away from the hole you just made in the same groove as well. Now you have a block with a groove and two holes in the grooves. Put the 1/8 inch steel rod through the one hole so it sticks out the side without the groove about 4 inches. Bend the rod so it is flat on the groove and take it out of the hole and bend it again so it looks like a staple so the rod goes through the two holes with the rod protruding out on the side with no groove about 4 inches and the other hole is the rest of the rod protruding out on the same side. Now bend the side with the long rod sticking up down flat to the surface and cut it off so it is about 2 inches on the surface. Cut the other rod protruding up at 2.5 inches. This is your coring spindle and is used to make a core through he propellant so it burns all at once giving it power to fly.
Steel rod pushed through holes in board.
A ball mill is used for grinding stuff into a fine powder. It consists of a rotating drug with the chemical you want to grind and a grinding medium such as lead balls that do the grinding of the powder. The drum rotates and tumbles the powder and balls grinding it into a fine dust. One place to buy a ball mill is at toy stores or Wal-Mart. You can buy them as irock tumblersi. These rock tumblers are used by hobbyists to polish stones so they are smooth. You can pick one up for about 15-30 dollars. Although you can get bigger more expensive ones off the net and actual ball mills from companies that sell them for about 60-100 dollars. Or you could make your own and I'll leave that up to you to figure out.
Ok so now that you have your irock tumbleri you need something to grind with. For grinding black powder and rocket fuel I use marbles. You can use lead shot from the gun department or brass also works (you can cut up a brass rod from the hardware store to make milling media). Never use steel! Because steel balls can spark and that will equal a bad time for you if your grinding black powder or other flammable mixture. Also don't grind mixtures that are unstable or sensitive. NEVER GRIND FLASH POWDER!!!!!
For pyrotechnics you're going to want to have a good balance. I got an Ohaus triple beam balance off of ebay for about 20 dollars. This balance had weights missing so I ordered them from the company for another 15 dollars. This is a good deal considering if you buy an Ohaus balance from the manufacture new it'll cost you about a hundred bucks! Balances can be quite expensive but they are very necessary if you are serious about pyrotechnics. Other cheaper alternatives could be diet scales used for measuring food or postage scales for weighing packages. These are not very accurate devices though. If you have a powder scale for reloading shells then that will work great.
Heat the sulfuric acid to 60-80 degrees Celsius using a hot water bath or a hotplate. Now slowly add the acetyl salicylic acid and it may fizz a little. Once you add the acetyl salicylic acid to the sulfuric acid it will be a really dark color. Keep this mixture at 60-80 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes so the sulfuric acid converts the acetyl salicylic acid to phenol and then to phenol sulfate.
Some TNP crystals from a second crop from the same yellow liquid.
9) Here is yet another mine with the 3 inch PVC html mortar but this one was my first star mine and I used sparklers for the stars. Not bad for a first attempt.
Mix up your star composition that you want to use for the comet. See the stars page on this site for formulas. I used my iyellowi star formula for this comet. Now wet the star powder with alcohol and mix it until it is a thick paste. I used alcohol instead of water so it would dry faster. Now place your 2inch toilet paper roll onto some wax paper and fill the tube with the star paste all the way to the top.
Now cut the end of the tube so you can fold it over as shown. Make a notch in the end of thee tube also so you can inset you sticky match and tape it into place.
Place the hydrogen peroxide in the refrigerator or an ice bath to cool it down to below 10 degrees Celsius.
After the hexamine is added now add the citric acid slowly to the mix making sure the temperature doesn't rise too much. I suggest holding the temperature at about 0-10 degrees Celsius. Now you should have a clear solution with everything dissolved. You may have some citric acid that didn't dissolve completely, this is ok and it doesn't matter that much.

sam on 16 Now it's illegal, a source of cheap, pure MPA in the UK
This is the steady march towards the UK government making all but their taxable and controlled illegal.
This is the address you should use. Sure, it's a leap of faith but if you're really that worried I'll send you a free sample.
This address will change - so double check each time! DEL: 16QSK6ssb8wuzi3yC8HHM7ecsrk2poKGdi :DEL 45 add
2. how much MPA you expect to receive
3. the address you want it posted to to
MPA is one of the first - and as it happens - one of my favourites.
How do I actually get the MPA then?
the UK >> 133 Buy cheap, pure MPA in the UK >> Now it's illegal, a source of cheap, pure MPA in the UK 134 PS10 in coin ... any coin ... 135 alternate 136 alternate
So this is a big subject but essentially it's about moving virtual cash from place to place. I suggest you start with sites like 245
