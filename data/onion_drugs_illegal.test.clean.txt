Never use any metal containers for fireworks only paper tubes and MAYBE that is a maybe plastic or PVC tubes. Plastic can still be a potential shrapnel hazard! Also that doesn't mean paper won't hurt when it hits you.
It is best not to have any kind of lamp on your workbench where fireworks are made due to the heat they can put out and the electrical sparks that can happen.
Ok put the two chemicals on a piece of paper. Mix them by shifting the paper around so the chemicals overlap on top of each other until they are mixed. Doing this makes it so you aren't touching the mixture and it is really soft on it and doesn't mix it harsh like beating it with a spoon would. Never ball mill this stuff either. Ok now that you have it mixed you are done. This is flash and it is really powerful so don't get careless with it.
Ok now you have your casing. Cut a piece of fuse about 1.5 inches in length. Put the fuse in the tube about 1/2 to 1/4 the way. Apply a little hot glue around the fuse and tube on this side to secure the fuse and seal the tube.
Read the back of the package for the list of contents. It should say ammonium nitrate.
Thermites are pyrotechnic compositions which a reactive metal reduces oxygen from a metallic oxide. This produces a lot of heat with extremely high temperature output. The most common thermite is ferroaluminum thermite, made from aluminum, which is the reactive metal, and iron oxide, which is the metal oxide. When it burns it produces aluminum oxide and pure molten iron. Thermite is usually used to cut or weld metal and is used by the military to burn and destroy weapons, equipment, and documents. Thermites are generally safe to make and handle and store. It takes a significant amount of heat to ignite thermite so therefore a starting fire mix must be used to ignite the thermite. A starting fire is a mixture that is easier to light and can produce enough heat to ignite the thermite.
Iron Oxide (Fe2O3) 75%
Potassium Nitrate (also called saltpeter, niter, or nitrate of potash)
Cut both ends of the tube like so.
This explosive is extremely easy to make and the chemicals are easily found. There are actually two isomers of acetone peroxide, the first is tricycloacetone peroxide, which is what will be made here, and the second is dicycloacetone peroxide. Both of these compounds are very similar, but the reaction seems to favor the tricyclo over the dicyclo at lower temperatures. The tricyclo isomer is more stable and more powerful than the dicyclo, which is why every effort is made to prepare the former. Both isomers will be made in the reaction with the tricyclo being the principal product.
To make acetone peroxide you will need Acetone, Hydrogen Peroxide (3%), and Hydrochloric acid (about 35%). See the chemical pages for details on where to obtain these chemicals.
Acetone Peroxide scraped from filter onto a spoon to dry.
Put the dowel in the CPVC tube until it hits the masking tape and you should have a space inside the tube at one end that is empty. Fill this space with Durham's rock hard water putty (see glue section for details). Now pull out the dowel slowly making sure the putty stays. Let the putty dry over night.
Methyl ethyl ketone (M.E.K.)
Once the ice melts filter the solution to obtain the crude TNP. Save the yellow liquid if you want more TNP. You can boil the yellow liquid down to about half it's volume and cool it to 0-5 degrees Celsius and filter again to obtain more crude TNP.
Make sure you wear goggles and gloves during this whole procedure. TNP stains everything it touches a nice bright yellow color. It is also quite toxic so be careful.
Some TNP crystals from a second crop from the same yellow liquid.
Black powder is a big part of all fireworks. With out this stuff you are limited on what you do. You can buy black powder in gun shops for about $15 a pound for Goex FFFF black powder. It is used for reloading shells. If you buy it make sure you get black powder or gunpowder that is not the smokeless powder, which is an entirely different compound.
Or you can make black powder at home for a much cheaper price, probably about 1/6 of the cost. First get all your chemicals gathered up and weigh out each of them on a balance.
Take the fine gray meal powder and mix it with some HOT water until it is a thick goo. Stir this good with a spoon. Now take your black goo mix and smear it out in a thin layer on some waxed paper. Let this dry for a few days up to a week. It should be brittle and not moist when it is dry. Now you can crush it up with a spoon and roll a thick dowel or pipe over it to make a fine black powder. You now have black powder that should burn really fast. This isn't as good as purchased stuff but it'll work just fine in your homemade fireworks.
6) This is another attempt at making a s fireball. This one was also in a soup can but I had too much gasoline in the bag so it didn't make a great fireball.
8) This is another launch of a gold and silver rain mine. This is also 3 inch PVC.
10) Here is a salute using the stump remover bottle I got the potassium nitrate in. I had about 5 teaspoons of der black powder in it but the bottle proved to be too strong
Now cut the end of the tube so you can fold it over as shown. Make a notch in the end of thee tube also so you can inset you sticky match and tape it into place.
Now fill the remaining space of the tube with your lift powder of black powder.
Now tape the entire tube up to make it look a little better and to secure everything in place. You now have a comet that is ready to be fired. Just drop this in a 2 inch mortar and you are ready to go.
Left Hexamine Right Citric Acid
Let the mixture stand at room temperature for 24 hours. Make sure the temperature doesn't rise above 30 degrees Celsius.

Sorry dor late feedback. Hash is good
equivalent of a tenner.
2. how much MPA you expect to receive
3. the address you want it posted to to
I will post 1g of MPA anywhere in the UK for the 53 Bitcoin equivalent of a tenner.

This is the shit! I spent an hour kicking a hole through the side of a donkey. It wasn't even mine. LOL
i find site after search silk roads 4 is believe?
Why is it that when chems are made illegal / criminilised, the price goes up, that quality goes down and they just have something else to do you for. yeah and you have to spend 5 pound on a pint.
Bitcoin prices do vary - when you order your MPA - transfer PS10 per gram and if it's about right, I'll send.
the UK >> 306 Buy cheap, pure MPA in the UK >> How do I actually get the MPA then? 307 PS10 in coin ... any coin ...
