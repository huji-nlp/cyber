"Vitamin B6 helps the body make several neurotransmitters, chemicals that carry signals from one nerve cell to another. It is needed for normal brain development and function, and helps the body make the hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which influence mood, and melatonin, which helps regulate the body clock." 27 www.umm.edu
"Because vitamin B6 is involved in many aspects of metabolism, several factors are likely to effect an individual's requirement for vitamin
B6. Of those factors, protein intake has been the most studied.
Increased dietary protein results in an increased requirement for vitamin B6." 28 www.oregonstate.edu Close
Vitamin E is a powerful natural antioxidant that helps to protect from free radicals, which damage skin cells and cause premature skin ageing. Vitamin E is sometimes used for improving physical endurance, increasing energy, reducing muscle damage after exercise, and improving muscle strength.
"Vitamin E is also used for cataracts, asthma, respiratory infections, skin disorders, aging skin, sunburns, cystic fibrosis, infertility, impotence, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), peptic ulcers, for certain inherited diseases and to prevent allergies." 29 www.webmd.com Read all authoritative sources opinions
"Vitamin E is also important in the formation of red blood cells and it helps the body use vitamin K. It also helps widen blood vessels and keep blood from clotting inside them. Cells use vitamin E to interact with each other and carry out many important functions."
"Vitamin E also increases the expression of two enzymes that suppress arachidonic acid metabolism, thereby increasing the release of prostacyclin from the endothelium, which, in turn, dilates blood vessels and inhibits platelet aggregation " 31 wwww.ods.od.nih.gov
"Vitamin E is found in foods such as vegetable oils and shortening, meat, eggs, milk, and leafy vegetables. Vitamin E is important for many processes in the body." 32 www.drugs.com
"The vitamin E-treated group also had significantly lower death rates from prostate cancer." 33 www.rxlist.com Close
