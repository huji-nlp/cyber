Hi guys! I'm sorry I have been away a week by serious family affairs that I can't give details... The store is e tly as is from the 7th of July (a week ago).

Thanks for reading, and my apologizes for those who are waiting their orders,
UPDATE 1: Listings are ready, but please check pics tomorrow 15th July. I make it better ones with daylight. Posted on 55 07/07/2016 by 56 ElHerbolario
Just I want to inform what will happen with weed prices for the next 2 months.
May you know (or not) that the summer time is very bad to grow indoors. Temperature is too high for a suitable grow conditions. Most growers already powered off his facilities some weeks ago.
At less production, prices raise (last summer got same problem) expect an increase of 20% on weed prices. And I will be very lucky if I can stay open in August, cause is almost imposible buy weed on this month.
I don't want to cause panic to customers, but if you plan to make some purchase, make it before prices raise.
To end this post with a good news, I want to remember that arround October, firsts outdoor harvest will be ready, with awesome tasty outdoor strains with unbeatable prices!

From now until Tuesday, 27% discount for all 20g orders of Bubble Gum and Big Skunk strains!
Don't miss this deal! May I run out of stock before promo ends! Posted on 796 14/05/201614/05/2016 by 797 ElHerbolario
Hello everyone! First of all, before I forget Urgent shipping are now available!
I bring news about extractions of hashish, now are divided into 3 classes: 1st Quality, 2nd Quality, 3rd Quality.
Extraction times are: 1st Quality 5 min, 2nd Quality 15 min, 3rd Quality 1 hour.
Not fool yourself about 2nd or 3rd quality. My 3rd quality beat any commercial hash that are sold on Darknet with different beautiful names but are the same shit.
I made these extractions myself, and I can guarantee there is no shit added.
Here I put some pictures to make reading more enjoyable
Posted on 804 11/05/201611/05/2016 by 805 ElHerbolario
"Indian legends say that the charas is so good that even the very god Shiva smoked when he retreated to the mountains to meditate. The charas - which means hand extracted hashish, is one of the greatest treasures of the Himalayas."
I have the great pleasure to present my own "Charas" directly extracted from the resin stick on trimming scissors, when the plant is still alive.
Try it yourself, and discover why is is considered the smoke of the gods
Posted on 808 03/05/201603/05/2016 by 809 ElHerbolario

Hello everyone! I bring some news that soon will rejoice the spirit and the senses!
New restock this weekend, I know what is going to add but just in case I publish later
I have already prepared all necessary tools to make regular cannabis extracts, so the goal is always to have everything. So, you only need one stop here to get all your desired cannabic products.
This week I will make quantitative measurements (qualitative are always the best that I can) to know the e t price per gram of each extraction (time, material, weed needed) thanks to my new equipment, it is possible that prices of all extractions fall significantly, maintaining the same quality that you are accustomed. But don't expect 7EUR per gram
Permanent listed extracts of: BHO, Dry Hash, Ice-O-Lator.
To summarize: - New strains in the next 48 hours. - Cannabis extracts PERMANENTLY listed. - Cannabis extracts probable price drop.
EDIT 1: I forget to say that very soon a new type of shipment will be added for any kind order: URGENT without tracking. (For what says postal service is like half time shipping, but knowing the lazy Spanish postal service... do not expect to save more of 30% of time compared with regular shipping, use at your own needs!)
Thanks for visiting us!
ElHerbolario Posted on 822 20/04/2016 by 823 ElHerbolario
I added some few more units of Dry Hash and also new "sample" listing.
Now customers can try our product and service making just a small order to know us first! :)

It seems that history is doomed to repeat itself forever?
I've always thought that the more people manage money, the more risk there.
If the news is finally confirmed, I hope that this will become a turning point. No more third party handling the money of all. Everyone should be responsible for their money and their business.
I hope I'm just wrong..

added on "Specials" category
Critical Mass Hydrophonic growed added for sale!
Also I separated most beautiful and bigger buds, ideal to share on a party with friends!
Here a little bit of info from leafly.com
Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk 1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.

Thank you all for the interest in making the tutorial, I received several and I'm working to get them on the shop.

Wanted editor to create a custom guide on how to buy bitcoins.
What is needed on guide? - It must be totally noob friendly, detailed step by step. (may be nice include some screenshots too, is just an idea) - Guide may be divided in 2 parts: 1- How to buy Bitcoins. 2- How to buy here with it. - Avoid copy/paste other tutorials. - Easy to be posted on site, don't make a PDF file
If you have some free time and correct spelling, there is a reward: 20g at your choice of any strain on sale free shipping.
Just open a ticket asking about :)
Thanks, ElHerbolario Posted on 917 07/03/2016 by 918 ElHerbolario

So, what are e tly the new features? No more "guest" purchases, this only cause problems, no more orders with misspelled address without any kind of way to contact buyer...No more customers asking for orders made as guest that don't remember the order number... User registration only require: Username and password. Captcha added to register form, easy one stoned customer proof. No any kind of personal data stored on our database. Profile show order history as always, but added cancel order button to customer side, if you make something wrong, you can make a request to cancel in one click. Customer can open a support ticket inside current order to get a faster help. This is very useful when customer emails you asking about one order but don't give any detail such order number. Support inside orders will speed the job a lot. Payments are now automatic verified, no more long checking times to find transactions and and summing multiple payments from Bitcoin mixers... Please be sure that your payment are sent in full (you can do it also in multiple payments) Cause if some coin missing, system don't validate payment until 100% full. Added a forum where everyone who wants can post how lovely is my weed or how slow is my service Just kidding, feel free to post anything being polite. Now website make full automatic backups each our and store it on a secure server. Orders database are now 100% guaranteed. You can't imagine how shitty is loosing orders from 4 days of sales... Server are DDOS secured now, as you can see site loading fast. I have confidence in stay always online. Added a raffle on forums, each month will be a new raffle, check forum for more info. Lowing a little bit all prices to bost again the site, and make this a bigger place. I dream to have a comunity talking in forums, no mater if is about competitors A blog with news and info about cannabis world will be nice, so if you think you have knowledge, and correct spelling, open a ticket. FAQ page added, maybe will be more detailed soon, but now it does the job
And last, but not least thanks for all my patient customers that are waiting their orders or my email replies, I have replied a lot, but still remaining a lot more to reply.

--BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-- Hash: SHA512
Hi, I sign this message to prove my identity. (read this message entire to know how verify this)
First of all I would like to apologize to my clients for the lack of communication during the last 10 days. It has not been easy...believe me!
I know that the server has had several fails due to suspicious traffic, and ended disabled. Last weeks I have been receiving several extortion messages to restore service... Obviously I have not accepted to pay. I suspect what happened, but I will not accuse anyone, because I think removing the shit does not help, just stink more.
Now, obviously the site is being rebuilt from zero. It is now 3:11am on February 23, and hope to have the site 100% operational within 8 hours (yes, I will not be able to sleep now ...)
I appreciate all customers who have placed an order after the February 18, to contact me by email to: elherbolario@sigaint.org to check the status of your order (it will be difficult but not impossible, and fortunately I have a temporary registration which can be useful) I repeat again, contact to SIGAINT email. Lelantos are abandoned cause the DDOS attack happened some weeks ago.
I sign this message with my PGP key to prove my identity. You can verify the validity of the key in "Grams" in the following link: http: grams72tru2gdpl2 /infodesk/vendor/0x3606DA418DA3DB32 Just copy entire message (like a pgp encrypted message) then paste in your PGP software and click on "verify" You will see that this message have been signed by ElHerbolario (elherbolario@lelantos.org) (if you change only one letter of this message, verification fails)
To finish this message, I would just like to add two things:
To my customers, I apologize for any inconvenience I might have caused, I hope to restore service and communication in the next few hours.
Those who have caused all this: You will not get a penny from me. You can continue or try somewhere else. But if you have some dignity, you will stop playing with livelihood of an entire family.
Thanks for reading, ElHerbolario --BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-- Version: GnuPG v1

I. Create a Bitcoin Wallet
First you have to create a bitcoin wallet to store your coins. You can store and control your wallet locally or web-based.
For web based storing and controlling 980 is one of the biggest providers. You are also able to download your wallet, and store it on an usb-drive for example. The site is also accessible via tor. The link you will find here
The other way is to install a 982 client on your computer. This allows you to send bitcoins and have a look at your balance without using a web-browser, as it is the case if you are using blockchain.
After the creation process, you will get an address to your wallet.
Note: Please follow the instructions during the wallet creation process carefully and attentively!
Now your wallets are created and waiting to get filled.
II. How to buy bitcoins
First you have to search for a seller for your bitcoins. (You can search via 983 for example). Please note, that some sellers are restricted in some countries.
Some examples for reliable sellers:
German banks have issues with it. Commercial seller)
restricted in many countries
FAQ: Can I buy BTC with paypal?
Answer: Yes and no. Some vendors on localbitcoins offer this option but most of the vendors do not offer paypal as payment option. There is a simple reason. BTC transactions cannot be reversed, if they were sent to a correct wallet address. But paypal payments can be reversed. To avoid this scam-opportunity the most of the BTC-Sellers do not offer to buy bitcoins with paypal.
Most accepted payment options are Credit Cards and some kinds of direct Bank transfers.
During the payment process, you have to enter your wallet address to receive your bitcoins. Now the bitcoins should have have arrived in your wallet.
As you can see, there are not many ways to buy bitcoins anonymously because of the payment options.
Buying bitcoins is legal according to the law.
But all Bitcoin transactions are public, traceable, and permanently stored in the bitcoin network.
III. Tumbling or not
Tumbling your bitcoins is like to put them in a big washing machine with tons of other bitcoins from other people. At the end you'll get randomized bitcoins. To receive the washed btc you should create a second wallet. (One wallet for the regular bought bitcoins and one virgin wallet only for the washed ones)
That makes it really hard to trace the btc. These tumbling services are not for free. You have to pay a fee.
Also note that these tumbling services are usually illegal. In the past, there were confirmed scams committed by some of the tumbling services. To check the actual status of the different services use the following link
For further information about bitcoin anonymity check this link:
Customers who have a online Blockchain-Wallet can use the embedded 'Shared Coin' option to tumble Bitcoins (easiest and fastest way):
If you are very paranoid, buy very huge amounts of dope or live in a very restrictive country you should tumble.
IV. How to use my bitcoins at Elherbolarios Personal Shop
It is very easy. At first click the category you prefer.
Please note: For bugfree using you must deactivate No Script
But if this message pops up, click "not now" always when it appears.
Choose one of these nice strains by clicking "select options"
Select your preferred quantity.
Select how often you want your preferred quantity. For example in the picture below:
Add it to you cart.
Now you can check out your cart
If you have a coupon code, you can redeem it now. You also have to specify your address, pgp encrypted of course. El Herbos public key you'll find at the bottom of the page. Copy and paste it. Save it in a text file to import it to your pgp tool to encrypt your address. Your encrypted address can be pasted in the order form now. Then click "Place order"
Now you'll be asked to send your bitcoins to a specific address. Make sure you copy and paste the values to avoid typing errors.
Also note that you have to send your payment within two hours. Otherwise your order will be canceled.
After sending the right value of bitcoins punctually to the right address, your order will be processd. Lean back and wait for el Herbos nice herbs.

Welcome to my personal shop for cannabis products!
I am an experienced dark market vendor/grower located in Spain. My main goal is to provide my customers with probably the best cannabis products in Europe at the lowest prices possible. After all the struggles and losses on the dark-net markets I decided to open up my own shop. I think that this is a win-win situation. This way you profit from lower prices on all your favorite products (as there are no additional fees) and I am more secure of market exit scams and falling Bitcoin rates.
I am doing this for living and to feed my family, so always expect from me professionalism and continuity. Happy and returning customers is what I want!:)
1. Which payment methods do you accept?
We only accept Bitcoins for payments.
2. Can I pay in hand?
Yes, you can go to pick and pay the order at your nearest police station...LOL! NO! OF COURSE NOT!
3. Where can I buy Bitcoins?
We recommend 1125 Happycoins for immediate coin receive or
4. Is it safe to order at your shop and what happens with my shipping
address after i received my order?
Yes, it is absolutely safe! Otherwise I would not be doing this for so long:). Two weeks after your order is shipped (and there are no complains from your side) your PGP encrypted address gets automatically deleted from the shop's database. That's why you have to put in your address in the according field each time you place a new order.
5. What about your shipping stealth? Can the product be smelled from
Please understand that due to security reasons I can't give out many information about the used stealth. But here are some important facts: I use business envelopes with printed sender and return addresses All products are double vacuum sealed. You will not be able to smell anything until you open the package. The package will blend in perfectly with your daily mail. All my packages fit into the standard mailbox slots.
6. Do I have to sign for my package when it arrives?
No, you don't need to sign for it. It will be dropped into your mailbox.
7. What are the next steps after purchase?
As soon as your payment is received in full, your order status will be set as "Procesing". You can check the status anytime on you account page.
8. I have paid, but order status still pending after 1 hour, what
Now payment verification is fully automated by the shop, if your payment is still pending after 1 hour, this means that some coin are missing. Check it again on Blockchain if the address has received the full amount (also works if you send more hahaha) For example, if payment is missing 0.0001 Bitcoins to be complete, system can't detect it as paid. Please, double check your payment to avoid unnecessary inconveniences.
9. How much time do I have to pay after checkout?
I recommend no more than 2 hours. Sometimes Bitcoins price is very volatile. If the Bitcoin rate falls extremely I can put your order on hold or refund it if the price has varied significantly. Note that the shop updates the Bitcoin price each 10 minutes to keep it as accurate as possible.
10. How long does it take until I receive my product?
It depends, take note that we don't ship on weekends (postal service don't work) But to give an idea: GER 3-7 days FR 3-7 days UK 7-12 days
If you haven't received your product within 15 days from set as "Sent" please contact us opening a support request ticket from inside your order. This does not guarantee anything. Refunds/reships always depend on the customer's trustworthy.
11. Can I purchase products without shop registration?
No, I decided remove this option because I had problems with users forgetting to add their address and order number. After 2-3 weeks then I receive messages asking about it. This was really annoying because it happened every week...
12. Is JavaScript necessary to view the shop?
Yes, products are "variable" this means they have multiple prices depending on the selected amount. This is a JavaScript function and you can't add products to the cart without JavaScript being enabled (you can just enable it to and then disable again).
13. I lost my account password. Can I recover it?
Usually no, due to security reasons email password recovery is turned off. Please create a new account or contact us giving some ownership proof to reset password.
14. Can I have a discount for big orders?
Usually no, the prices are already very good. Anyway you may contact me and I can evaluate depending on multiple factors.
15. I have some more questions before buying. How can I contact you?
Create an user account and then open a support ticket.
16. I'm afraid to order and don't receive it...
I can't help with this if you aren't convinced, but keep in mind that I do this to support my family, so it will not be very smart to scam people. Maybe you should check forums, reddit, deepdotweb about me first... my advice is keep yourself always informed before buying from any darknet vendor.
17. Last time I had ordered the site was offline for many days. Can
Well, I have redesigned the site completely. Also server config and hosting. I know that it is always a risk, nobody is risk free to be attacked on this places (also happens a lot on clearnet sites, so imagine how it is on the darknet...) but I have learned a lot from the past and now the site auto-backups on a safe emergency server daily. So, if something bad happens, I can restore all the site without loosing anything.
18. What about the quality of your products? I want to know what I'm
My products always come from very qualified growers. I do not buy anywhere and every batch I purchase is checked under the microscope. If it does not meet my quality standards I don't buy it, no matter whether it is a trusted provider or not. There are times when a batch is not as good as expected. (c) Elherbolario 2016

In dieser Anleitung wird im ersten Schritt der Kauf von Bitcoins erklart. Danach wird einem gezeigt, wie man Produkte hier im Shop kauft.
Navigieren Sie mit Ihrem Internet Browser zu 1233 www.bitcoin.de und erstellen Sie sich einen Account indem Sie in der oberen rechten Ecke auf "Registrieren" klickt.
Fullen Sie die folgenden Felder mit Ihrem gewunschtem Benutzernamen, Ihrer Email und Ihrem gewunschtem Passwort aus(Am besten eines mit Gross und Kleinbuchstaben, einer Zahl und einem Sonderzeichen). Geben Sie den Sicherheitscode ein bei ,,Ich bin kein Roboter" und setzen Sie die Hackchen:
Entscheidet Sie selbst, ob es Ihnen die 0,001 Bitcoins Wert sind, mit Newslettermails zugespammed zu werden, ich habe erstmal kein Hakchen beim Newsletter gesetzt. Das bleibt aber jedem selbst uberlassen!
Sie bekommen nun eine E-Mail mit einer URL um Ihren neu erstellten Account freizuschalten.
Gucken Sie zur Sicherheit auch in Ihr SPAM-Postfach, manchmal landet die Mail auch dort.
Klicken Sie auf den Link in der Email und melden Sie sich dann mit Ihren Daten an.
Ihnen wird nun per Email eine Login-Tan zugesendet, die Sie eingeben mussen.
Sie werden nun durch einen Prozess geleitet um Ihre Bankverbindung zu Verifizieren. Da dieser Schritt sehr gut von der Website begleitet wird, habe ich hierzu keine Bilder erstellt. (Falls doch jemand Hilfe braucht, stehe ich jederzeit zur Verfugung, schreib mir einfach
Geschafft! Nun wollen wir also unsere ersten Bitcoins kaufen! Klicken Sie dazu in der Menuleiste auf den Marktplatz, mit ,,1." gekennzeichnet. Danach setzen Sie bitte das Hakchen, auf dem Bild mit der ,,2." Gekennzeichnet.
Wahlen Sie nun ein Angebot welches Sie interessiert, aus, und klicken sie auch den roten Schriftzug ,,Kaufen".
Sie sehen nun folgendes
Geben Sie bei ,,1." die Menge Bitcoins an, die Sie kaufen mochten und klicken Sie dann auf ,,2." Jetzt Kaufen. Sie werden nun auf eine neue Seite weitergeleitet auf der Informationen zum Kauf zusammengefasst stehen.
Uberweisen Sie nun den Betrag auf das angegebene Konto, ich habe personliche Informationen rot gestrichen.
WICHTIG! Markieren Sie UNBEDINGT innerhalb von 60 Minuten den Kauf als ,,Bezahlt" ( Gelber Knopf in der Mitte obigen Bildes).
Sobald der Verkaufer den Zahlungseingang bestatigt hat, werden Ihrem Konto die BTC gutgeschrieben.
Dies kann einige Tage dauern, aber meist geschieht es schon am Tag darauf.
Herzlichen Gluckwunsch! Sie haben nun BTC gekauft und diese sind Ihrem Konto gutgeschrieben worden!
Falls Sie wollen, dass Ihre BTC schwieriger zuruckzuverfolgen sind, laden Sie sich das Programm Bitcoin Core herunter. Damit besitzen Sie auf Ihrem PC ein eigenes Wallet, auf das Sie BTC von Bitcoin.de Einzahlen konnen. Bitte lesen Sie hierzu am Ende den Bitcoin Core Teil.
Beginnen wir also nun mit dem Auszahlungsprozess! Dazu benotigen Sie eine verifizierte Mobilfunknummer. Navigieren Sie dazu zu ,,Einstellungen" und dann ,,Mobilfunknummer".
Fuhren Sie die angezeigten Schritte durch, sie werden von der Website durch den Vorgang begleitet.
Sobald Ihre Mobilfunknummer Verifiziert wurde:
Melden Sie sich bei Bitcoin.de an, und Navigieren Sie zu ,,Ein-/Auszahlungen".
Klicken Sie auf den Reiter ,,Auszahlung" um BTC an eine Adresse Ihrer Wahl zu Uberweisen. Sie konnen nun den Betrag und die Empfangeradresse eingeben, ausserdem mussen Sie ihr aktuelles Passwort eingeben. Ihnen wird nun per SMS eine sogenannte mtan ubermittelt sobald Sie auf ,,mTAN anfordern" klicken.
Geben Sie diese in das rot markierte Feld ein und klicken Sie auf ,,Uberweisung bestatigen".
Ihnen wird der Betrag den Sie eingegeben haben von Ihrem Konto abgebucht und auf die Empfangeradresse uberwiesen. Also entweder direkt an ElHerbolario oder an Ihr Wallet.
Bitcoin Core - Ihr eigenes Wallet
Dieser Teil ist fur diejenigen, die Sicherheit uber alles stellen und nicht mochten, dass Ihre BTC leicht zuruckzuverfolgen sind.
Laden Sie sich Bitcoin Core von 1234 herunter und installieren Sie das Programm.
Starten Sie das Programm.
Warten Sie bis sich das Netzwerk Synchronisiert hat.(der Balken unten) Dies kann unter Umstanden lange dauern, je nach Geschwindigkeit Ihrer Internetleitung und Computers.
Sie sehen im unteren Teil des Fensters den Fortschritt der Synchronisierung.
Um BTC zu empfangen, klicken Sie auf Empfangen. Geben Sie irgendeine Bezeichnung an, und den Betrag (minus der netzwerk-Gebuhr die bitcoin.de erhebt, gucken Sie am besten vorher wieviel das ist) ein der Empfangen werden soll.
Klicken Sie nun auf Zahlung anfordern.
Kopieren Sie die Adresse und geben Sie diese bei Bitcoin.de ein, die Schritte sind oben verzeichnet.
Sie haben bei Ihrem Kauf bei Elherbolario eine Empangeradresse bekommen.
Um an diese Adresse von Ihrem Bitcoin Core Wallet aus BTC zu uberweisen, gehen Sie wie folgt vor:
Klicken Sie auf ,,Uberweisen".
Geben Sie die Adresse die Sie bei Ihrem Kauf bei Elherbolario bekommen haben, und schliesslich die Menge, die Sie uberweisen mussen.
Die Menge BTC die Sie uberweisen mussen steht auch in der Rechnung bei Elherbolario.
Seien Sie vorsichtig bei der Transaktionsgebuhr, diese wird immer draufgerechnet.
Stellen Sie also sicher dass Sie genugend BTC zur Verfugung haben um sowohl Transaktionsgebuhr als auch den Betrag fur Elherbolario zahlen zu konnen.
Um die Transaktionsgebuhr festzulegen klicken sie auf ,,Auswahlen".
Sie konnen nun diverse Dinge festsetzen. Ich bin der Meinung, es ist selbsterklarend.
Falls dennoch jemand Fragen hat, bitte stellt Sie, ich werde dann den Walkthrough entsprechend deutlicher machen :)
Cannabis von Elherbolario beziehen:
Um einen Account zu registrieren, klicke auf ,,My Account".
Registriert euch auf der linken Seite mit eurem gewunschtem Nutzernamen und eurem gewunschtem Passwort. Lost die Aufgabe um zu beweisen dass Ihr kein Bot seid.
Klickt nun auf ,,Shop".
Wahlt eure gewunschte Kategorie.
Fur dieses Tutorial nehmen wir uns ein Indoor-Strain vor.
Klickt auf euer gewunschtes Produkt.
Als Beispiel haben wir uns 10g Amnesia Haze vorgeknopft :)
Bei ,,1" konnt ihr die Quantitat auswahlen, und mit ,,2" konnt Ihr das Produkt bestellen.
Normalerweise sieht das Ganze aber so aus, unter ,,choose option" konnt ihr wahlen wieviel Ihr haben mochtet. Nachdem Ihr ,, " geklickt habt, kommt Ihr hierhin:
Ansonsten klickt Ihr oben rechts das rot markierte Shopping cart.
Klickt nun auf ,,proceed to checkout".
Es gibt ein sehr gutes PGP Tut auf
Falls euer Englisch nicht gut sein sollte gibt es aber auch genugend Deutsche guides zu pgp. Sucht euch einen.
Gebt eure PGP verschlusselte Adresse unter ,,shipping address" ein und klickt auf ,,place order"(der grune button).
Ihr gelangt nun auf eine Seite wo euch die genaue Menge an BTC die Ihr uberweisen musst angezeigt wird sowie die Addresse an die die BTC geschickt werden mussen.
Ich hoffe das hilft etwas, wenn fragen bestehen fragt einfach
