Don Mills Programming Gala
As the school year comes to an end, we will be holding one final DMOPC in the form of the Don Mills Programming Gala.
This will be a live on-site competition and will take place at Don Mills Collegiate Institute on Monday, May 15th.
Schools wishing to provide their students with an opportunity to enrich their programming skills while competing against schools from across the GTA are invited to participate!
There will be a Bronze, Silver and Gold division, with each having MATH: <semantics> <mn>6</mn> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">6</annotation> </semantics> :MATH problems. Bronze -- the Bronze division will be roughly the difficulty of the Junior Division of the CCC and the Gr. 10 to 11 ICS curriculum. Only the last few questions require knowledge of array manipulation and sorting. Silver -- the Silver division is modeled after previous DMOPC difficulties. Problems from past DMOPC contests can be found 15 on the judge. Topics will range from intermediate logic to some more advanced algorithms. Gold -- for very experienced contest programmers highly confident in their programming ability. The Gold division provides an advanced problemset well beyond the curriculum, and will contain problems of CCO and IOI difficulty.
Participants may decide which contest to participate in on the day of the competition.
To prepare for the contest, we strongly recommend solving past DMOPC, DMPG and CCC problems. Calculators and printed materials are allowed.
Teachers / supervisors can register their school by completing the
The hard deadline to register is May 10th (five days before the event), but please understand that there may not be any space left at that time: registering earlier is therefore preferred. The registration may be edited at any point in time before the deadline to add or remove students.
After submitting a response, an email containing additional information and instructions will be sent out to the email address of the supervisor to confirm the registration.
The cost to participate in this event is MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant "normal">$</mi> <mn>10</mn> </mrow> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex"> $10</annotation> </semantics> :MATH per student, which is due upon registration as a cheque payable to Don Mills Collegiate Institute.
To encourage collaboration, teams of MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>1</mn> <mo>-</mo> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">1-2</annotation> </semantics> :MATH students are allowed, but each team is allowed one computer. Schools are allowed to send any number of teams, as long as the total number of participants does not exceed 20.
Note: Both the quantity and composition of teams must be determined by the registration deadline.
