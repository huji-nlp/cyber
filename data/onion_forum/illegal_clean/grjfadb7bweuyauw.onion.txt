LiberTORian 9 will be available soon. Featured articles on Negativland and Agenda 2030 Here is an excerpt: Devo was mentioned in the last issue of LiberTORian, but now the band got in the news. It looks like the lead singer and synthesizer player, Mark Mothersbaugh, held a wedding on the anniversary of 9/11. So here's the the deal: They decided to have a wedding cake in the form of the twin towers, and had the guests cut into it with box cutter blade. Post truncated. Click Reply to view.

Funny story...I had been following this mans final thoughts for the last couple of weeks. this is/was his official website. It all began as a suicide threat. Mercer was supposed to kill himself on cam for us on 9/28. I love gore and red room/snuff content so I bookmarked and was eagerly awaiting for this raging individual to end his life for all of our entertainment. After the 28th, I noticed that Mercers webpage switched from suicidal tendancies to homicidal/hatefull tendencies. I find his art very interesting. I find his mind...very interesting. You can clearly see how this man was troubled...to a certain extent...well...enough babbling from me. I INTRODUCE TO YOU..AN INSIGHT INTO A MIND LIKE FEW OTHERS. ENJOY.
" No1Again 15/10/06(Tue)09:19:39 55 No. 56 18 Just to point out, this man killed 15 people in oregon shooting..but it was not his first time killing. He is a long time serial killer. The media refuses to tell us the entire truth..only bits and pieces. This man had been threatening to go on a rampage for over 3 weeks. If I were getting paid by the government...I would have probably made an effort to end this before it began...but it was not my battle to fight. Don't be fooled into believe that the government and media dont know about his personal web page...they just choose not to reveal this "sensitive" information...Well i say "FUCK THAT AND FUCK YOU" . I am no sheep nor will I be decieved by the wolf.
