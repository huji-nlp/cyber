what is original proof
In the world where information travels in light speed, how can you prove to somebody that an idea is really originated from your brain, not you copy from someone else? how do we define similarity of ideas? The answer is impossible. Since even you don't copy it from someone else, many others may have come to that similar idea too.
Suppose you know what digital signature is. Whenever you have a crazy idea and the google search gets nothing similar to your idea, you may put it in an article. You sign that article and send it to a public stamper which timestamp your article and sign back to you. You can then have an evidence of your idea and since it is timestamped by a public stamper, it is really the earlest one on Earth. Ultimately. the community will tell you if your idea is really original or not.

Hi all! I'm proud to present my new shop with an amazing design, and heavily improved features!
I wanted to start with a clean fresh database, so customers will need to signup again in the new site.
Here it is the ElHerbolario genuine onion adresses:

Hi guys! I'm sorry I have been away a week by serious family affairs that I can't give details... The store is e tly as is from the 7th of July (a week ago).
And during the next few minutes I'll update the listings with stunning new strains!
This are HD pics, I posted without preview because I don't know why it reduces image size.
I just received this new Amnesia Haze batch, check it!
Really well growed, trimmed and dried! This is one of this batches that I feel very very proud to sell it! :)
Right now I'm working on backend to customize few things: Products display price in Euro / Bitcoin. Price rate updates each 10 mins. Improved customer panel. New notifications badges. Improved checkout page. Improved customer registration. Customer can check in his order history the amount and bitcoin adress of each order placed.
I expect to have it ready arround the second week of July. (Finally taken more work than expected)
Check how your favorite shop will look soon!
So, this was the bad news..and now the good news!
Also Cannalope Haze restock next week. Already harvested some time ago, and currently drying.

Do you still have Cannalope? I can't find it in the shop.
Hi! Sorry, is out of stock :( Monday I restock some other amazing strains :)
Just ordered one! Really nice to see a strain with citrus smell and taste! Hope there will be more in the future!

From now until Tuesday, 27% discount for all 20g orders of Bubble Gum and Big Skunk strains!
Extraction times are: 1st Quality 5 min, 2nd Quality 15 min, 3rd Quality 1 hour.
Not fool yourself about 2nd or 3rd quality. My 3rd quality beat any commercial hash that are sold on Darknet with different beautiful names but are the same shit.
I have the great pleasure to present my own "Charas" directly extracted from the resin stick on trimming scissors, when the plant is still alive.
Try it yourself, and discover why is is considered the smoke of the gods
Don't miss the ONLY 24h discount of 812 Dancehall strain! You get it at 4.99EUR/g!
Have a nice shopping day!
New restock this weekend, I know what is going to add but just in case I publish later
Thanks for visiting us!
I added some few more units of Dry Hash and also new "sample" listing.

Enjoy! Very soon listings up!

It seems that history is doomed to repeat itself forever?
I've always thought that the more people manage money, the more risk there.
If the news is finally confirmed, I hope that this will become a turning point. No more third party handling the money of all. Everyone should be responsible for their money and their business.
I hope I'm just wrong..
Now custom bulks open to everyone! Save up to 25% on your order starting from 150g to 1000g max.
Also I separated most beautiful and bigger buds, ideal to share on a party with friends!
of your favorite weed for free on your next order.

As tittle says! Also added glass jars pic of the stock on sale.
I'm proud to announce that site starts rolling again with new and amazing features that will simplify my life and makes your purchases simple, secure, always knowing status and in order to manage the possible questions or requests you may have.
Also thanks to all support messages received on multiple places.
First of all I would like to apologize to my clients for the lack of communication during the last 10 days. It has not been easy...believe me!
I know that the server has had several fails due to suspicious traffic, and ended disabled. Last weeks I have been receiving several extortion messages to restore service... Obviously I have not accepted to pay. I suspect what happened, but I will not accuse anyone, because I think removing the shit does not help, just stink more.
I appreciate all customers who have placed an order after the February 18, to contact me by email to: elherbolario@sigaint.org to check the status of your order (it will be difficult but not impossible, and fortunately I have a temporary registration which can be useful) I repeat again, contact to SIGAINT email. Lelantos are abandoned cause the DDOS attack happened some weeks ago.
Those who have caused all this: You will not get a penny from me. You can continue or try somewhere else. But if you have some dignity, you will stop playing with livelihood of an entire family.
I. Create a Bitcoin Wallet
The other way is to install a 982 client on your computer. This allows you to send bitcoins and have a look at your balance without using a web-browser, as it is the case if you are using blockchain.
After the creation process, you will get an address to your wallet.
Note: Please follow the instructions during the wallet creation process carefully and attentively!
Now your wallets are created and waiting to get filled.
II. How to buy bitcoins
FAQ: Can I buy BTC with paypal?
Answer: Yes and no. Some vendors on localbitcoins offer this option but most of the vendors do not offer paypal as payment option. There is a simple reason. BTC transactions cannot be reversed, if they were sent to a correct wallet address. But paypal payments can be reversed. To avoid this scam-opportunity the most of the BTC-Sellers do not offer to buy bitcoins with paypal.
During the payment process, you have to enter your wallet address to receive your bitcoins. Now the bitcoins should have have arrived in your wallet.
III. Tumbling or not
If you are very paranoid, buy very huge amounts of dope or live in a very restrictive country you should tumble.
IV. How to use my bitcoins at Elherbolarios Personal Shop
It is very easy. At first click the category you prefer.
Add it to you cart.
If you have a coupon code, you can redeem it now. You also have to specify your address, pgp encrypted of course. El Herbos public key you'll find at the bottom of the page. Copy and paste it. Save it in a text file to import it to your pgp tool to encrypt your address. Your encrypted address can be pasted in the order form now. Then click "Place order"
Now you'll be asked to send your bitcoins to a specific address. Make sure you copy and paste the values to avoid typing errors.

I am doing this for living and to feed my family, so always expect from me professionalism and continuity. Happy and returning customers is what I want!:)
2. Can I pay in hand?
No, you don't need to sign for it. It will be dropped into your mailbox.
8. I have paid, but order status still pending after 1 hour, what
Now payment verification is fully automated by the shop, if your payment is still pending after 1 hour, this means that some coin are missing. Check it again on Blockchain if the address has received the full amount (also works if you send more hahaha) For example, if payment is missing 0.0001 Bitcoins to be complete, system can't detect it as paid. Please, double check your payment to avoid unnecessary inconveniences.
I recommend no more than 2 hours. Sometimes Bitcoins price is very volatile. If the Bitcoin rate falls extremely I can put your order on hold or refund it if the price has varied significantly. Note that the shop updates the Bitcoin price each 10 minutes to keep it as accurate as possible.
10. How long does it take until I receive my product?
If you haven't received your product within 15 days from set as "Sent" please contact us opening a support request ticket from inside your order. This does not guarantee anything. Refunds/reships always depend on the customer's trustworthy.
11. Can I purchase products without shop registration?
12. Is JavaScript necessary to view the shop?
Yes, products are "variable" this means they have multiple prices depending on the selected amount. This is a JavaScript function and you can't add products to the cart without JavaScript being enabled (you can just enable it to and then disable again).
13. I lost my account password. Can I recover it?
Create an user account and then open a support ticket.
16. I'm afraid to order and don't receive it...

In dieser Anleitung wird im ersten Schritt der Kauf von Bitcoins erklart. Danach wird einem gezeigt, wie man Produkte hier im Shop kauft.
Navigieren Sie mit Ihrem Internet Browser zu 1233 www.bitcoin.de und erstellen Sie sich einen Account indem Sie in der oberen rechten Ecke auf "Registrieren" klickt.
Gucken Sie zur Sicherheit auch in Ihr SPAM-Postfach, manchmal landet die Mail auch dort.
Ihnen wird nun per Email eine Login-Tan zugesendet, die Sie eingeben mussen.
Sie werden nun durch einen Prozess geleitet um Ihre Bankverbindung zu Verifizieren. Da dieser Schritt sehr gut von der Website begleitet wird, habe ich hierzu keine Bilder erstellt. (Falls doch jemand Hilfe braucht, stehe ich jederzeit zur Verfugung, schreib mir einfach
Geschafft! Nun wollen wir also unsere ersten Bitcoins kaufen! Klicken Sie dazu in der Menuleiste auf den Marktplatz, mit ,,1." gekennzeichnet. Danach setzen Sie bitte das Hakchen, auf dem Bild mit der ,,2." Gekennzeichnet.
Geben Sie bei ,,1." die Menge Bitcoins an, die Sie kaufen mochten und klicken Sie dann auf ,,2." Jetzt Kaufen. Sie werden nun auf eine neue Seite weitergeleitet auf der Informationen zum Kauf zusammengefasst stehen.
Dies kann einige Tage dauern, aber meist geschieht es schon am Tag darauf.
Herzlichen Gluckwunsch! Sie haben nun BTC gekauft und diese sind Ihrem Konto gutgeschrieben worden!
Beginnen wir also nun mit dem Auszahlungsprozess! Dazu benotigen Sie eine verifizierte Mobilfunknummer. Navigieren Sie dazu zu ,,Einstellungen" und dann ,,Mobilfunknummer".
Melden Sie sich bei Bitcoin.de an, und Navigieren Sie zu ,,Ein-/Auszahlungen".
Klicken Sie auf den Reiter ,,Auszahlung" um BTC an eine Adresse Ihrer Wahl zu Uberweisen. Sie konnen nun den Betrag und die Empfangeradresse eingeben, ausserdem mussen Sie ihr aktuelles Passwort eingeben. Ihnen wird nun per SMS eine sogenannte mtan ubermittelt sobald Sie auf ,,mTAN anfordern" klicken.
Ihnen wird der Betrag den Sie eingegeben haben von Ihrem Konto abgebucht und auf die Empfangeradresse uberwiesen. Also entweder direkt an ElHerbolario oder an Ihr Wallet.
Bitcoin Core - Ihr eigenes Wallet
Um BTC zu empfangen, klicken Sie auf Empfangen. Geben Sie irgendeine Bezeichnung an, und den Betrag (minus der netzwerk-Gebuhr die bitcoin.de erhebt, gucken Sie am besten vorher wieviel das ist) ein der Empfangen werden soll.
Seien Sie vorsichtig bei der Transaktionsgebuhr, diese wird immer draufgerechnet.
Um die Transaktionsgebuhr festzulegen klicken sie auf ,,Auswahlen".
Klickt nun auf ,,Shop".
Klickt auf euer gewunschtes Produkt.
Ansonsten klickt Ihr oben rechts das rot markierte Shopping cart.
Klickt nun auf ,,proceed to checkout".
Falls euer Englisch nicht gut sein sollte gibt es aber auch genugend Deutsche guides zu pgp. Sucht euch einen.
Ich hoffe das hilft etwas, wenn fragen bestehen fragt einfach
