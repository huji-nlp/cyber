To end this post with a good news, I want to remember that arround October, firsts outdoor harvest will be ready, with awesome tasty outdoor strains with unbeatable prices!
I noticed that some customers ask me if this Amnesia Haze batch have less trichomes because weed photos on listing are not very shinny :)
So today I made some more pics with daylight (old ones was made with poor light) check it, same batch from previous pics!
This are HD pics, I posted without preview because I don't know why it reduces image size.

My mouth is watering with anticipation!
Extraction times are: 1st Quality 5 min, 2nd Quality 15 min, 3rd Quality 1 hour.
Not fool yourself about 2nd or 3rd quality. My 3rd quality beat any commercial hash that are sold on Darknet with different beautiful names but are the same shit.
I have the great pleasure to present my own "Charas" directly extracted from the resin stick on trimming scissors, when the plant is still alive.

I've always thought that the more people manage money, the more risk there.
Here a little bit of info from leafly.com
Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk 1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.

Skunk No. 1 (Hydrophonic)

I know that the server has had several fails due to suspicious traffic, and ended disabled. Last weeks I have been receiving several extortion messages to restore service... Obviously I have not accepted to pay. I suspect what happened, but I will not accuse anyone, because I think removing the shit does not help, just stink more.
I sign this message with my PGP key to prove my identity. You can verify the validity of the key in "Grams" in the following link: http: grams72tru2gdpl2 /infodesk/vendor/0x3606DA418DA3DB32 Just copy entire message (like a pgp encrypted message) then paste in your PGP software and click on "verify" You will see that this message have been signed by ElHerbolario (elherbolario@lelantos.org) (if you change only one letter of this message, verification fails)

Welcome to my personal shop for cannabis products!
I am an experienced dark market vendor/grower located in Spain. My main goal is to provide my customers with probably the best cannabis products in Europe at the lowest prices possible. After all the struggles and losses on the dark-net markets I decided to open up my own shop. I think that this is a win-win situation. This way you profit from lower prices on all your favorite products (as there are no additional fees) and I am more secure of market exit scams and falling Bitcoin rates.
1. Which payment methods do you accept?
2. Can I pay in hand?
We recommend 1125 Happycoins for immediate coin receive or
Yes, it is absolutely safe! Otherwise I would not be doing this for so long:). Two weeks after your order is shipped (and there are no complains from your side) your PGP encrypted address gets automatically deleted from the shop's database. That's why you have to put in your address in the according field each time you place a new order.
9. How much time do I have to pay after checkout?
I recommend no more than 2 hours. Sometimes Bitcoins price is very volatile. If the Bitcoin rate falls extremely I can put your order on hold or refund it if the price has varied significantly. Note that the shop updates the Bitcoin price each 10 minutes to keep it as accurate as possible.
11. Can I purchase products without shop registration?
Yes, products are "variable" this means they have multiple prices depending on the selected amount. This is a JavaScript function and you can't add products to the cart without JavaScript being enabled (you can just enable it to and then disable again).
13. I lost my account password. Can I recover it?
Usually no, the prices are already very good. Anyway you may contact me and I can evaluate depending on multiple factors.
My products always come from very qualified growers. I do not buy anywhere and every batch I purchase is checked under the microscope. If it does not meet my quality standards I don't buy it, no matter whether it is a trusted provider or not. There are times when a batch is not as good as expected. (c) Elherbolario 2016
