I am a quant (aka, financial engineer) and leading a quant team. I always start introducing myself by "I love playing with models" so that most people will be astonished by this pun. Indeed, financial derivative instrument and dynamic hedge and relevent models are really really sexy to me. To experiment innovative instrument and hedge idea, programming capability is a must and that is also my leisure fun.
In the world where information travels in light speed, how can you prove to somebody that an idea is really originated from your brain, not you copy from someone else? how do we define similarity of ideas? The answer is impossible. Since even you don't copy it from someone else, many others may have come to that similar idea too.

May you know (or not) that the summer time is very bad to grow indoors. Temperature is too high for a suitable grow conditions. Most growers already powered off his facilities some weeks ago.
I noticed that some customers ask me if this Amnesia Haze batch have less trichomes because weed photos on listing are not very shinny :)

Not fool yourself about 2nd or 3rd quality. My 3rd quality beat any commercial hash that are sold on Darknet with different beautiful names but are the same shit.
Here I put some pictures to make reading more enjoyable
Try it yourself, and discover why is is considered the smoke of the gods
Just 45 units of 10g added (450g total amount) Listing can be murchased multiple times, just I added like this to keep stock under control.
Have a nice shopping day!
I have already prepared all necessary tools to make regular cannabis extracts, so the goal is always to have everything. So, you only need one stop here to get all your desired cannabic products.
To summarize: - New strains in the next 48 hours. - Cannabis extracts PERMANENTLY listed. - Cannabis extracts probable price drop.
EDIT 1: I forget to say that very soon a new type of shipment will be added for any kind order: URGENT without tracking. (For what says postal service is like half time shipping, but knowing the lazy Spanish postal service... do not expect to save more of 30% of time compared with regular shipping, use at your own needs!)
Thanks for visiting us!
Now customers can try our product and service making just a small order to know us first! :)
Check the nice pics of 830 Cannalope Haze and 831 Bubble Gum. (click on images to full-size view)
Here you can see how are made the cannabis extracts that you can buy (same ones, own pics)
Enjoy! Very soon listings up!
If the news is finally confirmed, I hope that this will become a turning point. No more third party handling the money of all. Everyone should be responsible for their money and their business.
Critical Mass Hydrophonic growed added for sale!
Thank you all for the interest in making the tutorial, I received several and I'm working to get them on the shop.
I take this opportunity to announce that I have just received another strain, formerly was the one that had more sales:
Check the store within an hour to view photos and listing available for sale!
opening a new ticket here in the shop.
As tittle says! Also added glass jars pic of the stock on sale.
And last, but not least thanks for all my patient customers that are waiting their orders or my email replies, I have replied a lot, but still remaining a lot more to reply.
Also thanks to all support messages received on multiple places.
First of all I would like to apologize to my clients for the lack of communication during the last 10 days. It has not been easy...believe me!
To my customers, I apologize for any inconvenience I might have caused, I hope to restore service and communication in the next few hours.
Those who have caused all this: You will not get a penny from me. You can continue or try somewhere else. But if you have some dignity, you will stop playing with livelihood of an entire family.
The other way is to install a 982 client on your computer. This allows you to send bitcoins and have a look at your balance without using a web-browser, as it is the case if you are using blockchain.
First you have to search for a seller for your bitcoins. (You can search via 983 for example). Please note, that some sellers are restricted in some countries.
Some examples for reliable sellers:
During the payment process, you have to enter your wallet address to receive your bitcoins. Now the bitcoins should have have arrived in your wallet.
III. Tumbling or not
Also note that these tumbling services are usually illegal. In the past, there were confirmed scams committed by some of the tumbling services. To check the actual status of the different services use the following link
Select how often you want your preferred quantity. For example in the picture below:
If you have a coupon code, you can redeem it now. You also have to specify your address, pgp encrypted of course. El Herbos public key you'll find at the bottom of the page. Copy and paste it. Save it in a text file to import it to your pgp tool to encrypt your address. Your encrypted address can be pasted in the order form now. Then click "Place order"
After sending the right value of bitcoins punctually to the right address, your order will be processd. Lean back and wait for el Herbos nice herbs.
Jabber: elherbolario@wtfismyip.com (Daily online to assist you)
e-mail: elherbolario@sigaint.org (I do not check it often)
Yes, you can go to pick and pay the order at your nearest police station...LOL! NO! OF COURSE NOT!

4. Is it safe to order at your shop and what happens with my shipping
Yes, it is absolutely safe! Otherwise I would not be doing this for so long:). Two weeks after your order is shipped (and there are no complains from your side) your PGP encrypted address gets automatically deleted from the shop's database. That's why you have to put in your address in the according field each time you place a new order.
5. What about your shipping stealth? Can the product be smelled from
6. Do I have to sign for my package when it arrives?
As soon as your payment is received in full, your order status will be set as "Procesing". You can check the status anytime on you account page.
9. How much time do I have to pay after checkout?
12. Is JavaScript necessary to view the shop?
Yes, products are "variable" this means they have multiple prices depending on the selected amount. This is a JavaScript function and you can't add products to the cart without JavaScript being enabled (you can just enable it to and then disable again).
13. I lost my account password. Can I recover it?
14. Can I have a discount for big orders?
Create an user account and then open a support ticket.
16. I'm afraid to order and don't receive it...
Well, I have redesigned the site completely. Also server config and hosting. I know that it is always a risk, nobody is risk free to be attacked on this places (also happens a lot on clearnet sites, so imagine how it is on the darknet...) but I have learned a lot from the past and now the site auto-backups on a safe emergency server daily. So, if something bad happens, I can restore all the site without loosing anything.

In dieser Anleitung wird im ersten Schritt der Kauf von Bitcoins erklart. Danach wird einem gezeigt, wie man Produkte hier im Shop kauft.
Fullen Sie die folgenden Felder mit Ihrem gewunschtem Benutzernamen, Ihrer Email und Ihrem gewunschtem Passwort aus(Am besten eines mit Gross und Kleinbuchstaben, einer Zahl und einem Sonderzeichen). Geben Sie den Sicherheitscode ein bei ,,Ich bin kein Roboter" und setzen Sie die Hackchen:

Dies kann einige Tage dauern, aber meist geschieht es schon am Tag darauf.

Geben Sie diese in das rot markierte Feld ein und klicken Sie auf ,,Uberweisung bestatigen".
Warten Sie bis sich das Netzwerk Synchronisiert hat.(der Balken unten) Dies kann unter Umstanden lange dauern, je nach Geschwindigkeit Ihrer Internetleitung und Computers.
Kopieren Sie die Adresse und geben Sie diese bei Bitcoin.de ein, die Schritte sind oben verzeichnet.
Klicken Sie auf ,,Uberweisen".
Die Menge BTC die Sie uberweisen mussen steht auch in der Rechnung bei Elherbolario.
Um die Transaktionsgebuhr festzulegen klicken sie auf ,,Auswahlen".
Sie konnen nun diverse Dinge festsetzen. Ich bin der Meinung, es ist selbsterklarend.
Um einen Account zu registrieren, klicke auf ,,My Account".
Fur dieses Tutorial nehmen wir uns ein Indoor-Strain vor.
Als Beispiel haben wir uns 10g Amnesia Haze vorgeknopft :)
Normalerweise sieht das Ganze aber so aus, unter ,,choose option" konnt ihr wahlen wieviel Ihr haben mochtet. Nachdem Ihr ,, " geklickt habt, kommt Ihr hierhin:
Ansonsten klickt Ihr oben rechts das rot markierte Shopping cart.
Es gibt ein sehr gutes PGP Tut auf
Gebt eure PGP verschlusselte Adresse unter ,,shipping address" ein und klickt auf ,,place order"(der grune button).

This is the opportunity to check your files for AV detections on real system without files execution.
This is the opportunity to execute your files and make a test on workability of them on real system with almost all major Windows OS versions.
We provide an advanced API to operate checking and testing process from 3thd party apps.
Very informative reports with status of detection, detection type, timeout and screenshots of desktop and detections. You will be able to share them with everyone or save to JPG or PNG file.
AV Check & OS Test customization
With our history of scans you will be able to see all history of your checks and their status at any time you need. Events history can show you every action you made in service for all time: payments, checks, plans
We fully pass Pafish tests using own technologies and know-how when running test machines. Thus, it can't be detected by any anti-VM tricks.
We use a set of common software like WinRar, Notepad , Microsoft Office, Adobe Reader, Java, Chrome, Firefox and etc on test machines like any user system has.
This scan type can help you to check if your files are detected dynamically by antivirus (or Internet Security) solutions while executed by all detection types.
