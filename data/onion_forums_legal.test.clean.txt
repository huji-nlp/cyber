As the school year comes to an end, we will be holding one final DMOPC in the form of the Don Mills Programming Gala.
This will be a live on-site competition and will take place at Don Mills Collegiate Institute on Monday, May 15th.
There will be a Bronze, Silver and Gold division, with each having MATH: <semantics> <mn>6</mn> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">6</annotation> </semantics> :MATH problems. Bronze -- the Bronze division will be roughly the difficulty of the Junior Division of the CCC and the Gr. 10 to 11 ICS curriculum. Only the last few questions require knowledge of array manipulation and sorting. Silver -- the Silver division is modeled after previous DMOPC difficulties. Problems from past DMOPC contests can be found 15 on the judge. Topics will range from intermediate logic to some more advanced algorithms. Gold -- for very experienced contest programmers highly confident in their programming ability. The Gold division provides an advanced problemset well beyond the curriculum, and will contain problems of CCO and IOI difficulty.
The cost to participate in this event is MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant "normal">$</mi> <mn>10</mn> </mrow> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex"> $10</annotation> </semantics> :MATH per student, which is due upon registration as a cheque payable to Don Mills Collegiate Institute.
Note: Both the quantity and composition of teams must be determined by the registration deadline.
Don Mills C.I is located just west of the Lawrence exit on the Don Valley Parkway. It is close to the intersection of Don Mills and Lawrence. It can be accessed by MATH: <semantics> <mn>3</mn> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">3</annotation> </semantics> :MATH bus routes: The MATH: <semantics> <mn>25</mn> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">25</annotation> </semantics> :MATH Don Mills bus at Lawrence Avenue, from there, walk one block east to reach the school, from Pape and Don Mills stations. The MATH: <semantics> <mn>54</mn> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">54</annotation> </semantics> :MATH Lawrence East bus at The Donway East, from Eglinton and Lawrence East stations. The MATH: <semantics> <mn>162</mn> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">162</annotation> </semantics> :MATH Lawrence-Donway bus at Greenland Road, from Lawrence station ( MATH: <semantics> <mn>30</mn> <annotation encoding "application/x-tex">30</annotation> </semantics> :MATH minute frequency).
