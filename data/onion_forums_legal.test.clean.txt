This will be a live on-site competition and will take place at Don Mills Collegiate Institute on Monday, May 15th.
Schools wishing to provide their students with an opportunity to enrich their programming skills while competing against schools from across the GTA are invited to participate!
Participants may decide which contest to participate in on the day of the competition.
To prepare for the contest, we strongly recommend solving past DMOPC, DMPG and CCC problems. Calculators and printed materials are allowed.
Note: Both the quantity and composition of teams must be determined by the registration deadline.
Lunch is included in the registration fee and will be served shortly after the competition ends.
