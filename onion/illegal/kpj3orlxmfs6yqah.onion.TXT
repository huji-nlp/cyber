MUSHBUD ‚Äì Shipping


   10G sizes are sent as ‚ÄúMachine Sorted First Class Letter-Mail‚Äù (AKA
   Snail Mail).  These 10G Packs can take up to 30 Days to arrive, even
   for my domestic customers.  If you need an expedited delivery, you
   should purchase elsewhere.  The majority of my packages will arrive in
   the time frames I‚Äôve listed further down on this page.  I‚Äôm very
   serious that 25% of my packs will arrive late, it‚Äôs been this way since
   the start.

     If you are not prepared to wait up to a full 30 Days for delivery,
     please make your purchase elsewhere.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Orders with multiple package(s) will be shipped out (separately) at
   least 24-48 hours apart to stagger arrival dates both at the boarder
   and to your local address.  This is done for your safety, to reduce any
   suspicions from customs agents or your local post office.  This is why
   I do not combine ship.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I Ship World Wide!
     __________________________________________________________________

   I ship from Canada, but the majority of my orders are to people
   residing outside of Canada.  My #1 destination is to the USA, with the
   UK close behind.

   I sell many packs to Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland.  The
   Viking Countries are GOLDEN!

   At this point, I have shipped successfully to nearly every European
   Country!

   Russia & Eastern Europe have been good so far, but very slow often
   needing more then 30 days.

   Central & South America, (other then Brazil) all countries have been
   successful albeit very slow at times requiring 5 weeks in some cases.

   Asian sales have been low, but from what I have sent they have been
   successful.  Some popular destinations include  India, Japan, China and
   Thailand.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Shipping Times:
     __________________________________________________________________

   I do not offer expedited shipping.  All packages are sent first class
   letter-mail, and comply to strict ‚ÄúMachine Sorted‚Äù Letter mail
   standards.

   The package should not (in most cases) take more then 30 days to reach
   you. From past experience, I expect my shipping times to be (Business
   Days):

   Canada 5-7 Days | USA 7-12 Days | UK 7-12 Days | Europe 10-20 Days |
   AUS & NZ 10-20 Days | Russia 25-35 Days | Central & South America 20-30
   Days |

   In many cases, the package will take less then 10 business days to
   arrive. HOWEVER, I do not control the mail!.. In some cases (In some
   parts of the world) it may take up to 30 days to receive (Russia I‚Äôm
   looking at you).
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you are not prepared to wait a full 30 days (in worst case
   scenarios)‚Ä¶ then do not order from me please. 25% of my packs do arrive
   later then expected! (Even my domestic can arrive later then 10-12
   days).

   Please also allow the 24-48 Hours it will take to Process and ship your
   order.
     __________________________________________________________________

     Orders placed on Friday/Saturday/Sunday will be processed and put in
     the mail Sunday night for pickup on Monday Afternoon. This is due to
     Canada Post being closed on Saturday & Sunday.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Country Warnings:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Israel & All Middle East & North
   Eastern African countries will be classified  ‚Äúbuy at your own risk‚Äù
   for any purchase of any size.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Australia & New Zealand.  Your combined purchasing power once made you
   #2 on my shipment destination list.  The hammer came down in 2014, and
   I was unable to reach higher then a 50/50 success rate with my 10G
   packs.

   Since that time I have created my new (30)G pack, which was designed
   Specifically with Aus & NZ in mind!  I have put a lot of effort in to
   this stealth, and I am now abiding to the ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù of Australian
   Officials inspecting these new packs.  I have shipped several dozen of
   these new (30)G packs to Aus & NZ all with 100% success.  You can now
   buy with confidence!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Israel.  We once had a good relationship you and I! Your sales higher
   then even my own domestic.  I was told that your postal security had
   increased in late 2013, your government began inspecting all mail for
   terrorist activity.  Buy at your own risk!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Brazil.  You were once my busiest South American destination, until a
   rash of reports from customers claiming their (10)G packages were not
   arriving.  I suspect though, that these claims were largely fraudulent‚Ä¶
   Perpetuated by a group of douche bags looking to profit on my (10)G
   guarantee.  Regardless, Brazil is now ‚ÄúBuy at Your Own Risk‚Äù.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì Stealth


   I have 2 forms of stealth.  One specifically for (10)G the other for
   (30)G and larger.
     __________________________________________________________________

   About the (10)G Stealth:

   The stealth is ULTRA SNEAKY.  It is disguised to look like any other
   mailing sent out a million times a day. The package does not shift
   weight when moved, does not produce strange sounds or smells. There
   will be -no- scent‚Ä¶ the contents will be bagged (Mylar laminate) &
   vacuum sealed! The package is plain and inconspicuous, no identifying
   marks or strange shapes. It is very small/thin and will fit in to any
   mailbox.

   Should the package be opened, it has been labeled and presented in a
   way to (hopefully) deceive a customs agent in to believing that it is
   something legal. So far it has done a very good job at that!
     __________________________________________________________________

   About the (30)G + Stealth:

   (30)G stealth is my best stealth. The package is naturally larger then
   (10)G as it contains 3x the content.  The extra size has allowed me to
   elaborate on the presentation.

   It now looks completely professional, exactly as you would expect a
   product to look as if it was purchased legally from a reputable online
   business.  Customs would need to send your package to a laboratory to
   know for certain that it was illegal.

   I have crafted this packaging technique, with extra attention to
   detail.  My goal was to produce a reliable stealth capable of passing
   Australia‚Äôs notoriously strict visual inspection.  So far it has been
   doing an excellent job!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Both stealth techniques will be professionally labeled, including a
   Return Address. This return address is FAKE, so be sure to double check
   your mailing address is correct in the PGP message you provide. This is
   your responsibility.  If the pack is returned to sender, there will be
   no getting it back!

     Do NOT try to contact me at the fake return address or the fake
     information included with the package!

   Not having a name on the package will raise suspicion, you must provide
   a name with your address. This name should be associated with the
   address!  Fake names on PO Boxes are more often then not returned to
   sender!  This seems to be a postal policy in many countries.

   My packs do not and will never require a signature. They will be
   delivered to your mailbox/slot with your bills & junk mail. Be sure not
   to throw it out by accident!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Precaution!

   Regardless of the quality of the stealth, suspicions can be raised at
   YOUR boarder when the arrival frequency is high.  If you are ordering
   too many packages too soon, eventually someone with authority will
   confiscate your packages, to err on the side of caution even if they
   can‚Äôt prove it illegal.

   I ship multiple package orders 24 hours apart to stagger arrival days.
   Even so, Several packages arriving from Canada in a short period of
   time will no doubt peak the attention of some Government official in
   your Country.  Use your discretion, and purchase only what you need‚Ä¶
   wait to purchase additional packages when they are needed.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì FAQ

    [15]Add comments

   Frequently Asked Questions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do I Register for your site? What will I need?

   You will only need a working email address, a password & user name of
   your choosing.

   Your email address must be a traditional top level domain. ie:
   .com/.net/.org (and the newer ones) it can not be a .onion

   The script will send a verification link to your email address, to
   ensure it is valid.  Please double check your email address is correct
   before clicking the submit button.

   When you receive the link, you should cut and paste it to your TOR
   Browser‚Ä¶  Clearnet services will not be able to resolve the .onion URL
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do I place an order?

   We will assume that you have already registered for the site, and have
   decided which of the products you‚Äôd like to purchase.

     You will need a couple things, primarily Bitcoin (BTC) and PGP
     Knowledge.

   I do not enforce PGP, personally I believe it‚Äôs up to you to decide the
   risk‚Ä¶ but understand there is risk! Learning and using PGP will make
   you feel much safer, but you may send your personal details
   unencrypted.

     TOR is encrypted end to end, so the chances of interception during
     transmission is very low.  However, if my site was ever seized or
     hacked, there may be traces of unencrypted details you do not want
     people to discover.  Using PGP will prevent this outcome.

   Have your Bitcoin ready, do not start the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù process until your
   Bitcoin is available and ready to send.  When you purchase Bitcoin, you
   should purchase a little more then you are expecting to spend, just to
   be sure as the price will fluctuate.

   Now lets assume you have Bitcoin and PGP.

   You can find my PGP key listed above from my main menu.  You will need
   to copy and paste that information (unedited) in to a blank .txt file
   (name it MUSHBUD).

   You can then ‚Äúimport‚Äù that MUSHBUD.txt file in to your PGP Program of
   choice.  I highly recommend GPA for linux / [16]Gpg4win for MS /
   [17]gpgtools.org for OSX

   You should now see my MUSHBUD name in your PGP software with the email
   address mushbud@tormail.org  This email is no longer in use ([18]why?)

   From inside your PGP program, open the ‚Äúclipboard‚Äù and write down your
   full name and mailing address. It should appear something like so:
     * FirstName LastName
     * 1234 Something St./Ave.
     * APT #1 (optional)
     * City State/Prov Zip/Postal
     * COUNTRY

   Now we can encrypt this message using my PGP Key.  You should see a
   button that says ‚Äúencrypt‚Äù, when clicked you should see the option to
   choose MUSHBUD.  Choosing MUSHBUD should bring up a confirmation
   screen, press accept and your message should now be encrypted. Cut (do
   not edit) the entire message and save to another blank .txt file.

   We can now proceed to the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù.

   Assuming your cart has been filled with the products you wish to
   purchase, press the checkout button.

   Under the column named billing details we see a box labeled ‚ÄúYour PGP
   Message‚Äù.  Copy and paste the PGP message we just created in to that
   box, or if you would prefer you could now type in to that box your full
   name and mailing address.

   Please select your country from the drop down list, and if not already
   selected for you click on the ‚ÄúPay with Bitcoin‚Äù option.

   If you have any additional details/comments you‚Äôd like to communicate
   about the order (or just to say hi!) type that in the order notes.

   Assuming you currently have java-script turned off, you will see a box
   named ‚Äúupdate totals‚Äù towards the bottom of your screen.  Please click
   that now.

   If you haven‚Äôt already clicked the Terms box, you will see a message to
   do so.  Click on the Terms link (it will open a new window) and please
   read and understand them (it is brief).  If you agree to the terms, now
   click this box.

   Prepare your BTC now, whether you have to login to a secure Web service
   or fire up your BTC program‚Ä¶ do that now.  Once you click the ‚Äúplace
   order‚Äù box you will have no more then 2 hours for the payment to be
   received and verified by the processor.  So be prepared to send
   immediately.

   Are you ready to order? Let‚Äôs assume you are and press the button! =)

   Did you press the button? Let‚Äôs assume that you did =P

   You will now see a screen with both the BTC amount, and the BTC address
   to send to.

     Your BTC amount needs to be EXACT.  Do not round up or down. Ensure
     that your transaction fee has already been calculated and added.
     The payment processor will check the receiving BTC address for the
     precise amount. Once it is seen on the block-chain the order will be
     completed.

   The software will move an order from ‚Äúpending‚Äù to ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù after 3
   confirmations on the Blockchain.

   That‚Äôs it!  You should (in most cases) receive a confirmation email
   that your payment was received followed up with a confirmation once
   your shipment has been physically put in the mail box.  That means
   exactly that, I‚Äôve gone out and put the pack in the box.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -What dosages do you recommend?

   I cover that question in detail, in this [19]article.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do you recommend I consume your powdered mushrooms?

   I cover that question in detail, in this [20]article.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do I store these shrooms, how long will they last?

   Storing your shrooms has now been made easier.  You can keep the
   shrooms in the packaging they arrive in.  An air tight seal, while
   being kept in a cold/cool & dark place, your opened package could last
   up to a year and maybe longer.

   Humidity, Heat, Air and Light are enemies to your shrooms.  Prevent
   these by placing your package in to the freezer and they may last
   several years.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -Do your shrooms come in capsules (gel caps)?

   They do not (for stealth reasons).  The powder is fine enough that you
   could use them with your own gel cap machine.  You can often find the
   machine on sale for around $25.  Do a Google search for ‚Äúcap-m-quik‚Äù,
   the standard for inexpensive homemade capsules.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -Do you accept Privnote instead of PGP?

   No I do not.  The reason is that Privnote requires that I enable
   java-script in order to read the message.  This is a dangerous thing
   for Vendors.  I would suggest using this service instead:

       I have been following you faq, downloaded GPG suite for Mac OS,
       signed up to protonmail etc.
       Where you say:
       From inside your PGP program, open the ‚Äúclipboard‚Äù and write down
       your full name and mailing address. It should appear something like
       so:
       FirstName LastName
       1234 Something St./Ave.
       APT #1 (optional)
       City State/Prov Zip/Postal
       COUNTRY
       Now we can encrypt this message using my PGP Key. You should see a
       button that says ‚Äúencrypt‚Äù, when clicked you should see the option
       to choose MUSHBUD. Choosing MUSHBUD should bring up a confirmation
       screen, press accept and your message should now be encrypted. Cut
       (do not edit) the entire message and save to another blank .txt
       file.
       Where do I find the clipboard. How do I open it from within GPG?
       Sorry‚Ä¶I ma a newbiem

            I‚Äôve not used the Mac OSX version myself, but the GPA Linux
            and Win version are practically identical. I will have to
            assume the Mac version is pretty close in design.
            In the Linux/Win version, when you launch the GPA program, it
            opens to an interface that has several icons.
            One of those Icons is the clipboard. You can hover your mouse
            over each icon, and a description will appear.
            Please let me know if that helps, if not I can take a closer
            look at the Mac version, there should be a youtube video
            available to watch that will walk you through the interface.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì FAQ

    [15]Add comments

   Frequently Asked Questions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do I Register for your site? What will I need?

   You will only need a working email address, a password & user name of
   your choosing.

   Your email address must be a traditional top level domain. ie:
   .com/.net/.org (and the newer ones) it can not be a .onion

   The script will send a verification link to your email address, to
   ensure it is valid.  Please double check your email address is correct
   before clicking the submit button.

   When you receive the link, you should cut and paste it to your TOR
   Browser‚Ä¶  Clearnet services will not be able to resolve the .onion URL
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do I place an order?

   We will assume that you have already registered for the site, and have
   decided which of the products you‚Äôd like to purchase.

     You will need a couple things, primarily Bitcoin (BTC) and PGP
     Knowledge.

   I do not enforce PGP, personally I believe it‚Äôs up to you to decide the
   risk‚Ä¶ but understand there is risk! Learning and using PGP will make
   you feel much safer, but you may send your personal details
   unencrypted.

     TOR is encrypted end to end, so the chances of interception during
     transmission is very low.  However, if my site was ever seized or
     hacked, there may be traces of unencrypted details you do not want
     people to discover.  Using PGP will prevent this outcome.

   Have your Bitcoin ready, do not start the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù process until your
   Bitcoin is available and ready to send.  When you purchase Bitcoin, you
   should purchase a little more then you are expecting to spend, just to
   be sure as the price will fluctuate.

   Now lets assume you have Bitcoin and PGP.

   You can find my PGP key listed above from my main menu.  You will need
   to copy and paste that information (unedited) in to a blank .txt file
   (name it MUSHBUD).

   You can then ‚Äúimport‚Äù that MUSHBUD.txt file in to your PGP Program of
   choice.  I highly recommend GPA for linux / [16]Gpg4win for MS /
   [17]gpgtools.org for OSX

   You should now see my MUSHBUD name in your PGP software with the email
   address mushbud@tormail.org  This email is no longer in use ([18]why?)

   From inside your PGP program, open the ‚Äúclipboard‚Äù and write down your
   full name and mailing address. It should appear something like so:
     * FirstName LastName
     * 1234 Something St./Ave.
     * APT #1 (optional)
     * City State/Prov Zip/Postal
     * COUNTRY

   Now we can encrypt this message using my PGP Key.  You should see a
   button that says ‚Äúencrypt‚Äù, when clicked you should see the option to
   choose MUSHBUD.  Choosing MUSHBUD should bring up a confirmation
   screen, press accept and your message should now be encrypted. Cut (do
   not edit) the entire message and save to another blank .txt file.

   We can now proceed to the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù.

   Assuming your cart has been filled with the products you wish to
   purchase, press the checkout button.

   Under the column named billing details we see a box labeled ‚ÄúYour PGP
   Message‚Äù.  Copy and paste the PGP message we just created in to that
   box, or if you would prefer you could now type in to that box your full
   name and mailing address.

   Please select your country from the drop down list, and if not already
   selected for you click on the ‚ÄúPay with Bitcoin‚Äù option.

   If you have any additional details/comments you‚Äôd like to communicate
   about the order (or just to say hi!) type that in the order notes.

   Assuming you currently have java-script turned off, you will see a box
   named ‚Äúupdate totals‚Äù towards the bottom of your screen.  Please click
   that now.

   If you haven‚Äôt already clicked the Terms box, you will see a message to
   do so.  Click on the Terms link (it will open a new window) and please
   read and understand them (it is brief).  If you agree to the terms, now
   click this box.

   Prepare your BTC now, whether you have to login to a secure Web service
   or fire up your BTC program‚Ä¶ do that now.  Once you click the ‚Äúplace
   order‚Äù box you will have no more then 2 hours for the payment to be
   received and verified by the processor.  So be prepared to send
   immediately.

   Are you ready to order? Let‚Äôs assume you are and press the button! =)

   Did you press the button? Let‚Äôs assume that you did =P

   You will now see a screen with both the BTC amount, and the BTC address
   to send to.

     Your BTC amount needs to be EXACT.  Do not round up or down. Ensure
     that your transaction fee has already been calculated and added.
     The payment processor will check the receiving BTC address for the
     precise amount. Once it is seen on the block-chain the order will be
     completed.

   The software will move an order from ‚Äúpending‚Äù to ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù after 3
   confirmations on the Blockchain.

   That‚Äôs it!  You should (in most cases) receive a confirmation email
   that your payment was received followed up with a confirmation once
   your shipment has been physically put in the mail box.  That means
   exactly that, I‚Äôve gone out and put the pack in the box.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -What dosages do you recommend?

   I cover that question in detail, in this [19]article.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do you recommend I consume your powdered mushrooms?

   I cover that question in detail, in this [20]article.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -How do I store these shrooms, how long will they last?

   Storing your shrooms has now been made easier.  You can keep the
   shrooms in the packaging they arrive in.  An air tight seal, while
   being kept in a cold/cool & dark place, your opened package could last
   up to a year and maybe longer.

   Humidity, Heat, Air and Light are enemies to your shrooms.  Prevent
   these by placing your package in to the freezer and they may last
   several years.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -Do your shrooms come in capsules (gel caps)?

   They do not (for stealth reasons).  The powder is fine enough that you
   could use them with your own gel cap machine.  You can often find the
   machine on sale for around $25.  Do a Google search for ‚Äúcap-m-quik‚Äù,
   the standard for inexpensive homemade capsules.
     __________________________________________________________________

   -Do you accept Privnote instead of PGP?

   No I do not.  The reason is that Privnote requires that I enable
   java-script in order to read the message.  This is a dangerous thing
   for Vendors.  I would suggest using this service instead:

     __________________________________________________________________

   Feel free to ask a question in this comment section, but please make it
   a question worthy of the FAQ.  Simple questions such as ‚Äúwhen will xXx
   be back in stock?‚Äù belong in the forum [22]Help Desk!

       I have been following you faq, downloaded GPG suite for Mac OS,
       signed up to protonmail etc.
       Where you say:
       From inside your PGP program, open the ‚Äúclipboard‚Äù and write down
       your full name and mailing address. It should appear something like
       so:
       FirstName LastName
       1234 Something St./Ave.
       APT #1 (optional)
       City State/Prov Zip/Postal
       COUNTRY
       Now we can encrypt this message using my PGP Key. You should see a
       button that says ‚Äúencrypt‚Äù, when clicked you should see the option
       to choose MUSHBUD. Choosing MUSHBUD should bring up a confirmation
       screen, press accept and your message should now be encrypted. Cut
       (do not edit) the entire message and save to another blank .txt
       file.
       Where do I find the clipboard. How do I open it from within GPG?
       Sorry‚Ä¶I ma a newbiem

            I‚Äôve not used the Mac OSX version myself, but the GPA Linux
            and Win version are practically identical. I will have to
            assume the Mac version is pretty close in design.
            In the Linux/Win version, when you launch the GPA program, it
            opens to an interface that has several icons.
            One of those Icons is the clipboard. You can hover your mouse
            over each icon, and a description will appear.
            Please let me know if that helps, if not I can take a closer
            look at the Mac version, there should be a youtube video
            available to watch that will walk you through the interface.

   I hope everyone had a great holiday season!

   I‚Äôve just added (90) 30G packs to inventory and another (7) 60G.  Next
   harvest is a small one planned for late Jan, and a large one planned
   for mid Feb.  I still  have Dozens of 10G in stock.

   The Xmas season kept my hands busy with Family, so I‚Äôm a bit behind in
   my work.   I‚Äôll be ramping up my grows again for bigger harvests.  I
   suspect though that the current supply will most likely be enough for
   Jan at current rate of sales.  So no expectations of being sold out
   this month‚Ä¶ early February will be touch and go but March will have big
   yields.

   Thanks again for all the support you‚Äôve shown me over the years, and
   happy new year!

   Hey Guys.

   I just wrapped up my harvests for February, and committed the remainder
   of what was grown to (60)G as it was nearly sold out.  There‚Äôs another
   25+ (60)G up for sale now.  I expect this supply will last through most
   of March.  There may be a couple weeks where 60G is sold out during
   Late March & Early April.

   My next harvest is scheduled for Mid March‚Ä¶ (10)G are becoming very
   popular again, so I will be committing a majority of March‚Äôs harvests
   to that amount.  I expect the (30)G I have in stock to last until my
   early April Harvests where I will replenish that amount & the (60)G.

   Everything is ticking along nicely, I hope you‚Äôre all doing well.  See
   you in the future!

       put your newer PGP key above your older key. studies show people
       only read the first part of the page, and therefore will use your
       lesser secure key.
       or, just take down your older key because there‚Äôs no reason to
       still use it!
       thanks, have a great day. stay safe

            My old key is not compromised, so there‚Äôs no need to take it
            down. It is the key that many of my older customers will use
            to verify that this is in fact the same MUSHBUD that they have
            been doing business with over the years.
            I‚Äôd like to believe that people still have the intelligence to
            inform themselves, and upgrade to the new key if that makes
            hem feel more secure.
            Like I mentioned on the page, I leave the choice up to them
            which in my mind is better then being told what to do.
            Ty for your concern!

MUSHBUD ‚Äì Policy


   I offer 2 products essentially.  My original (10)G Stealth, and my
   newer (30)G+ Stealth. (30)G+ Stealth has no guarantee of safe arrival,
   however the (10)G does to an extent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I will no longer guarantee more then 1 open Transaction of a quantity
   of (1) 10G Pack.  ‚ÄúTransaction‚Äù = The entire process, from your order
   to -in your hands- delivery.

   IE: The ideal Transaction would be that: the customer orders 1 (10)G,
   and then waits for that order to arrive, and then if they wish, they
   order another.

   This would make your ‚Äúopen‚Äù transaction a Finished or Closed
   transaction.  I will continue to guarantee those (10)G transactions
   100%

   If you are impatient and decide to order a pack every 24 hours: Then
   you have created several ‚ÄúOpen Transactions‚Äù of which I will only
   guarantee (1).

   If you order multiple (10)G packs all at once, and they are all seized‚Ä¶
   i will only guarantee 1 of those packs.

   If your packs are seized from the suspicion generated due to the extra
   traffic you‚Äôve created for your address, why would you expect me to be
   liable for your action?

   I refuse to be, so use your discretion and accept this risk on to
   yourself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   (30)G+ has been from it‚Äôs time of introduction a ‚Äúbuy at your own risk‚Äù
   purchase.

   In my previous markets (mainly SR2 & Agora) I would have the customer
   send me a confirmation PM that would have him/her indicate that they
   understood the risk was their own.  I now have a check box for terms on
   the order page.

   I have put my very best effort in to the (30)G+ stealth, it is very
   effective and so far has nearly 100% success.

   I can‚Äôt honestly say full 100%, to clarify the situation.  I have had 1
   customer who did not receive their pack after they had several packs a
   week sent to the same address in Africa over the course of 5 weeks.

   The frequency of identical shipments arriving to the same address over
   weeks will no doubt raise suspicions at your post office, especially if
   it‚Äôs a post office that does not ordinarily receive mail from Canada
   (or the western world).

   I caution people not to do this, please order what you need. 1 per week
   is acceptable for larger/populated Westernized Countries.

   I will not limit you as this is a customer‚Äôs ‚Äúacceptable risk‚Äù
   decision‚Ä¶  but understand this is one of the reasons why I will not
   guarantee these larger sizes.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì About


   I am the same MUSHBUD that had been servicing the DNM Scene since the
   original Silk Road, as well as SR2, Sheep, BMR, Agora & briefly at
   Abraxas.

   You can verify my PGP  (as well as read hundreds of my positive
   reviews) at GRAMS info Desk.  GRAMS is an independent resource created
   as a contact and verification point of Hundreds of Vendors across
   Dozens of DN Markets.

   [14]http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/infodesk/vendor/0xFE2A9F499FE544AB

   Registering with GRAMS will allow you to contact me with their internal
   mail system, as well as use their reliable Bitcoin mixing service.

   I am the same MUSHBUD who has frequented Reddit.com for the past 3+
   years.  I have created my own Sub Reddit which you can now reach at the
   following URL:

   [15]https://www.reddit.com/r/MUSHBUD/

   Doing a search for ‚ÄúMUSHBUD‚Äù on Reddit.com, will provide new customers
   with an even more comprehensive list of reviews spanning the life of
   several market places.

   I am the same MUSHBUD on TMG, you can visit my  [16]Vendor Post |
   [17]Review Post.

   I am the same MUSHBUD on THE HUB.  You can view my [18]Official HUB
   Review Thread.

   I am the same MUSHBUD who has been doing private sales via email.  The
   emails I currently use are:
    1. mushbud@protonmail.com (Primary).
    2. mushbud@lelantos.org ‚Äì (Backup) Use this as a last resort.  They
       are not very reliable and I do not check it frequently.
    3. mushbud@sigaint.org (This email is currently offline, the
       sigaint.org service is apparently out of business.  DO NOT send
       email to this address.)

     The email used in my PGP Key (mushbud@tormail.org) is no longer
     under my control as it was seized by the FBI during the ‚Äúfreedom
     hosting‚Äù Raid in 2013.

Product Description

   Before you order, please be sure to have read ‚Äú[24]my policy‚Äú.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is my classic offering! What I am offering is a 10 Gram pack
   (package) of my Magic Mushroom *Powder*, which is a Psilocybe Cubensis,
   Strain: Penis Envy (PE).

   My shrooms are quality and potent, 100% pure Cubensis and home-grown.
   There is no chance of wild mushroom contamination. The mushrooms are
   ground to powder to help conceal the contents of the package.

     This is a Ground Product.  The product is ground to powder for
     stealth & Disguise. Once you receive your first pack you will
     understand why I‚Äôve chosen to do this. I do not sell whole
     mushrooms, nor will I make exceptions (not even for domestic).

   I will ship WORLD-WIDE. I will ship to New Customers, but you must
   limit yourself to (1) pack and wait to see that the order arrives
   safely before ordering more.

   I now include the price of shipping in to the product price.  The price
   you see here, is the total price.  Shipping is now included.

   The stealth is ULTRA SNEAKY, some people have thrown their packs in the
   garbage by accident.  Don‚Äôt do that!  I don‚Äôt refund carelessness =)

   Should the package be opened, it has been labeled and presented in a
   way to (hopefully) deceive a customs agent in to believing that it is
   something legal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I sell only prepacked product, no custom orders and no combined
   shipments.

     Each (10)G package (pack) will arrive as it‚Äôs own shipment.  This
     means ordering multiples will increase your mail frequency, and may
     raise suspicion.  If you require more then 10G I suggest looking at
     either the 30G or 60G as an alternative to multiple 10G.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ABOUT MUSHBUD:

   I had been selling Ground Mushroom & Weed products on The Silk Road,
   and had acquired thousands of positive reviews. I had held the #2
   position for psychedelics and the #1 position for Mushrooms when the
   site was taken down.

   I had also been selling on SR2/Sheep/BMR/Agora with thousands more
   successful transactions with pages and pages of positive reviews.

   My hope is to be serving you well in to the future!

       I gave the product to a friend so I won‚Äôt comment on the powder,
       but the stealth was really amazing and probably the best I‚Äôve seen
       on the DNM so far. It got thru the Australian customs just fine and
       ours is one of the most strictest border force in the world.

       Been chasing MUSHBUD on each marketplace he sold at and he is by
       far the most reliable source I have dealt with. Glad he is back
       again with this site, finally no need to worry about exit scams.
       My first order here arrived very quickly I think it was like a week
       to the UK which normally took longer so I am guessing the speed has
       also improved.
       Quality of the product is outstanding as always, can never go wrong
       with this guy. Keep up the good work mate and stay safe

       Product arrived within a week from my order, not sure of the exact
       time frame. Overall I was extremely happy with my Mushbud order,
       the stealth was extremely impressive. Have exchanged a few messages
       with Mush and he has always been polite and responded within 24
       hours, his customer service is very good. As far as the actual
       product goes, the strain seemed to be pretty potent. Took 2g and
       had a very positive experience.
       The price, stealth, customer service, and potency of this product
       left me very happy with my order. Definitely a good source for some
       quality Mush.

       First time buyer, found my new source. :) MUSHBUD‚Äôs stealth,
       product, customer service and website are all incredible and FAR
       exceeded my expectation. Stealth is so great that no LE/customs
       would ever open unless tipped off. Thanks MUSHBUD, you fucking
       rock.

       Product was payed for and sent out within a 24 hour period. 4DD to
       the UK, surprisingly fast for this time of year. The package is
       small, and MUSHBUD is not lying when he says his stealth is ‚Äúultra
       sneaky‚Äù, I was very impressed, one of the best stealth techniques
       I‚Äôve seen. My last trip on mushrooms was approx. 3 weeks ago, 1.4g
       cubes. I took 0.9g with my girlfriend (at approx 14:30) and we went
       for a walk, saw the most beautiful sunset at the peak of our trip
       (Approx 16:15) and returned home due to poor weather, the first
       notable come-down effects(if you can call them that) were at around
       18:45. We were sober enough to go to a dinner event at 19:30. The
       penis envy strain is notably stronger than the cubes I normally
       get, would this trip was about as strong as 1.2g though it‚Äôs hard
       to make a comparison, some aspects were more intense and some less.
       I hope to try a stronger dose a some point and will post a
       fairly-detailed review on the forums when that happens.
       The powder is much easier to consume than actual dried shrooms, the
       taste is nowhere near as strong. I placed my 0.9g as a thin layer
       across a McDonalds cheeseburger and tasted absolutely nothing,
       which was a great help as regular shrooms leave a nasty aftertaste
       which makes me a tad nauseus when coming up.
       Overall, I‚Äôd give 5 stars all round, fast shipping, excellent
       quality and stealth technique, and for MUSHBUD‚Äôs friendly persona.

Product Description

   Before you order, please be sure to have read ‚Äú[24]my policy‚Äú.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is my new style! What I am offering is a 30 Gram pack (package) of
   my Magic Mushroom *Powder*, which is a Psilocybe Cubensis, Strain:
   Penis Envy (PE).

   In my opinion, this is the safest size that I offer.  It‚Äôs success rate
   is higher then my (10)G, but it receives no guarantee.  I began
   offering 30G in Summer 2014 and have since shipped several hundred of
   these packs.  They are hands down the best success I have experienced.
   They have been opened and passed inspection in Australia several
   times!  I will guarantee that you love the stealth!
     __________________________________________________________________

   My shrooms are quality and potent, 100% pure Cubensis and home-grown.
   There is no chance of wild mushroom contamination. The mushrooms are
   ground to powder to help conceal the contents of the package.

     This is a Ground Product.  The product is ground to powder for
     stealth & Disguise. Once you receive your first pack you will
     understand why I‚Äôve chosen to do this. I do not sell whole
     mushrooms, nor will I make exceptions (not even for domestic).

   I will ship WORLD-WIDE. I will ship to New Customers, but you must
   limit yourself to (1) pack and wait to see that the order arrives
   safely before ordering more.

   I now include the price of shipping in to the product price.  The price
   you see here, is the total price.  Shipping is now included.

   The stealth is ULTRA SNEAKY‚Ä¶ you will not mistake this package as junk
   mail.

   Should the package be opened, it has been labeled and presented in a
   way to (hopefully) deceive a customs agent in to believing that it is
   something legal.  It has done this successfully many times!
     __________________________________________________________________

   I sell only prepacked product, no custom orders and no combined
   shipments.

     Each (30)G package (pack) will arrive as it‚Äôs own shipment.  This
     means ordering multiples will increase your mail frequency, and may
     raise suspicion.  If you require more then 30G I suggest looking at
     the 60G.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ABOUT MUSHBUD:

   I had been selling Ground Mushroom & Weed products on The Silk Road,
   and had acquired thousands of positive reviews. I had held the #2
   position for psychedelics and the #1 position for Mushrooms when the
   site was taken down.

   I had also been selling on SR2/Sheep/BMR/Agora with thousands more
   successful transactions with pages and pages of positive reviews.

   My hope is to be serving you well in to the future!

       Where do I begin? MUSHBUD, you are amazing. Best stealth I‚Äôve ever
       seen. I have never trusted another vendor like I trust you.
       Excellent seller, excellent mush, you could not make me happier.
       Thank you.

       Came in exactly 2wks to Australia. Super professional stealth,
       loved the way it was all done! MUSHBUD is the no.1 shop for
       shrooms!

       I‚Äôve followed Mushbud through several markets and he‚Äôs the absolute
       best vendor out there, period. Fantastic shrooms at a great price,
       and the high potency means you‚Äôre getting great value for your
       money. Most people can easily have a great trip on 1.5-2 grams. Of
       course I enjoy going balls out with 3.5-4 grams, but I would
       recommend that amount only for experienced psychonauts.
       Stealth is always great, and the powder stores for years without
       losing potency at all. Once you‚Äôve dealt with Mushbud you‚Äôll wish
       all other vendors were this reliable.

       Mushbud is the only seller in the DNM world that i followed outside
       of your regular DNM sites, the quality of his mushrooms are unlike
       any other, stealth is awesome, thanx MushBud and congrats on your
       new website.

   the stealth was really amazing and probably the best I&#039;ve seen on
   the DNM so far. It got thru the Australian customs just fine and ours
   is one of the most strictest border force in the world. <p>I gave the

   http://kpj3orlxmfs6yqah.onion/?page_id=53#comment-2995 I&#039;ve not
   used the Mac OSX version myself, but the GPA Linux and Win version are
   practically identical. I will have to assume the Mac version is pretty
   close in design. In the Linux/Win version, when you launch the GPA
   program, it opens to an interface that has several icons. One of those
   Icons is the clipboard. You can hover your mouse over each icon, and a
   description will appear. Please let me know if that helps, if not I can
   take a closer look at the Mac version, there should be a youtube video
   available to watch that will walk you through the interface.

   úclipboardù and write down your full name and mailing address. It should
   appear something like so: FirstName LastName 1234 Something St./Ave.
   APT #1 (optional) City State/Prov Zip/Postal COUNTRY Now we can encrypt
   this message using my PGP Key. You should see a button that says
   úencryptù, when clicked you should see the option to choose MUSHBUD.
   Choosing MUSHBUD should bring up a confirmation screen, press accept
   and your message should now be encrypted. Cut (do not edit) the entire
   message and save to another blank .txt file. Where do I find the
   clipboard. How do I open it from within GPG? Sorry...I ma a newbiem

   http://kpj3orlxmfs6yqah.onion/?p=1043#comment-2279 My old key is not
   compromised, so there&#039;s no need to take it down. It is the key
   that many of my older customers will use to verify that this is in fact
   the same MUSHBUD that they have been doing business with over the
   years. I&#039;d like to believe that people still have the intelligence
   to inform themselves, and upgrade to the new key if that makes hem feel
   more secure. Like I mentioned on the page, I leave the choice up to
   them which in my mind is better then being told what to do. Ty for your
   concern! <p>My old key is not compromised, so there&#8217;s no need to

   <p><em>ABOUT MUSHBUD:</em></p> <p>I had been selling Ground Mushroom

   <strong><em>thousands</em></strong> of positive reviews. I had held the
   #2 position for psychedelics and the #1 position for Mushrooms when the
   site was taken down.</p> <p>I had also been selling on
   SR2/Sheep/BMR/Agora with thousands more successful transactions with
   pages and pages of positive reviews.</p> <p><strong>My hope is to be
   serving you well in to the future!</strong></p>

MUSHBUD ‚Äì Shipping


   10G sizes are sent as ‚ÄúMachine Sorted First Class Letter-Mail‚Äù (AKA
   Snail Mail).  These 10G Packs can take up to 30 Days to arrive, even
   for my domestic customers.  If you need an expedited delivery, you
   should purchase elsewhere.  The majority of my packages will arrive in
   the time frames I‚Äôve listed further down on this page.  I‚Äôm very
   serious that 25% of my packs will arrive late, it‚Äôs been this way since
   the start.

     If you are not prepared to wait up to a full 30 Days for delivery,
     please make your purchase elsewhere.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Orders with multiple package(s) will be shipped out (separately) at
   least 24-48 hours apart to stagger arrival dates both at the boarder
   and to your local address.  This is done for your safety, to reduce any
   suspicions from customs agents or your local post office.  This is why
   I do not combine ship.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I Ship World Wide!
     __________________________________________________________________

   I ship from Canada, but the majority of my orders are to people
   residing outside of Canada.  My #1 destination is to the USA, with the
   UK close behind.

   I sell many packs to Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland.  The
   Viking Countries are GOLDEN!

   At this point, I have shipped successfully to nearly every European
   Country!

   Russia & Eastern Europe have been good so far, but very slow often
   needing more then 30 days.

   Central & South America, (other then Brazil) all countries have been
   successful albeit very slow at times requiring 5 weeks in some cases.

   Asian sales have been low, but from what I have sent they have been
   successful.  Some popular destinations include  India, Japan, China and
   Thailand.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Shipping Times:
     __________________________________________________________________

   I do not offer expedited shipping.  All packages are sent first class
   letter-mail, and comply to strict ‚ÄúMachine Sorted‚Äù Letter mail
   standards.

   The package should not (in most cases) take more then 30 days to reach
   you. From past experience, I expect my shipping times to be (Business
   Days):

   Canada 5-7 Days | USA 7-12 Days | UK 7-12 Days | Europe 10-20 Days |
   AUS & NZ 10-20 Days | Russia 25-35 Days | Central & South America 20-30
   Days |

   In many cases, the package will take less then 10 business days to
   arrive. HOWEVER, I do not control the mail!.. In some cases (In some
   parts of the world) it may take up to 30 days to receive (Russia I‚Äôm
   looking at you).
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you are not prepared to wait a full 30 days (in worst case
   scenarios)‚Ä¶ then do not order from me please. 25% of my packs do arrive
   later then expected! (Even my domestic can arrive later then 10-12
   days).

   Please also allow the 24-48 Hours it will take to Process and ship your
   order.
     __________________________________________________________________

     Orders placed on Friday/Saturday/Sunday will be processed and put in
     the mail Sunday night for pickup on Monday Afternoon. This is due to
     Canada Post being closed on Saturday & Sunday.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Country Warnings:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Israel & All Middle East & North
   Eastern African countries will be classified  ‚Äúbuy at your own risk‚Äù
   for any purchase of any size.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Australia & New Zealand.  Your combined purchasing power once made you
   #2 on my shipment destination list.  The hammer came down in 2014, and
   I was unable to reach higher then a 50/50 success rate with my 10G
   packs.

   Since that time I have created my new (30)G pack, which was designed
   Specifically with Aus & NZ in mind!  I have put a lot of effort in to
   this stealth, and I am now abiding to the ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù of Australian
   Officials inspecting these new packs.  I have shipped several dozen of
   these new (30)G packs to Aus & NZ all with 100% success.  You can now
   buy with confidence!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Israel.  We once had a good relationship you and I! Your sales higher
   then even my own domestic.  I was told that your postal security had
   increased in late 2013, your government began inspecting all mail for
   terrorist activity.  Buy at your own risk!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Brazil.  You were once my busiest South American destination, until a
   rash of reports from customers claiming their (10)G packages were not
   arriving.  I suspect though, that these claims were largely fraudulent‚Ä¶
   Perpetuated by a group of douche bags looking to profit on my (10)G
   guarantee.  Regardless, Brazil is now ‚ÄúBuy at Your Own Risk‚Äù.

       I ordered from Mushbud quite a while ago and the experience was so
       good I promised myself I would post a trip report at some point.
       The purchasing was as flawless as it could be with the slow
       confirmation times on the blockchain a few weeks back but several
       newbie questions with Mush cleared up all my concerns including him
       manually confirming my order and explaining his success rate for
       different packs.
       Anyway I get my shrooms after about a week to the eastern US,
       marvel at the clever stealth, and pack them into size 00 capsules
       just like it says on the website. My 10g pack filled something like
       37 gel caps for some reason so either I didn‚Äôt fill them very well
       or Mush sent me extra <3. Anyway I gave some out to friends and
       then took 3 to try them out. I ate lunch at noon and then drank
       water for the rest of the day followed by 3 of my gel caps with
       water at 6 o‚Äôclock and got in the shower.
       After about 30 minutes I started getting a sort of cramp and I was
       worried I might throw up because I had read that might happen but
       as I thought about it the cramps evaporated and were replaced by an
       absent minded euphoria. I sat in my bed this whole time so if
       you‚Äôre reading for some crazy adventure this isn‚Äôt the trip report
       to read haha. In about an hour I felt like I was ‚Äúpeaking‚Äù or as
       much as you can with such a small dose. It felt like there was
       energy all around me and when I held my breath the euphoria would
       peak and as I exhaled intense relaxation would engulf me. I did
       this holding breath game for about 20 minutes and then turned off
       my phone and sat and laughed at myself for so long I can‚Äôt
       remember. I felt so connected to the earth and every living thing
       on earth it was insane. The only visuals I remember are seeing my
       phone ‚Äúboiling‚Äù at one point but other than that the high was just
       this constant euphoric sensation and this buzz of electricity all
       around me. I listened to all of Drake‚Äôs more life twice which
       sounded absolutely amazing.
       Next thing I know I had to go to the bathroom because of all the
       water. When I got back into bed all the energy was gone much to my
       dismay. At this point I was starving so I went downstairs and made
       myself a giant meal.
       Overall this was one of, if not the, best experiences with drugs I
       have ever had. Thanks Mushbud for the quality shrooms at a great
       price, this experience was worth so much more than I paid. If you
       are reading this wondering if you should purchase or not I 100%
       recommend it. Thanks for reading!

       This is a verification announcement that the MUSHBUD found at Dream
       Market, is in fact myself.
       You will receive your product if purchased from MUSHBUD on DM.
       You can visit DM here: [23]DREAM MARKET
       I think it may be the oldest market still in existence, It
       definitely has that old school feel which I‚Äôm a fan of, and one of
       the reasons I‚Äôve opened a shop there.
       It‚Äôs a bit chaotic in there right now, and you probably won‚Äôt find
       my offerings by just browsing. So search MUSHBUD on the site and
       you will find me.
       I will only offer my 10G on other markets. Anything larger will
       have to be purchased here on my own site.
       I‚Äôve opened the DM shop to alleviate any doubts that some new
       customers may have about MUSHBUD. You can now purchase my 10G worry
       free with full ESCROW on DM.

       Hey Guys.
       After visiting several Vendor forums, it‚Äôs beginning to look like
       Dream Market has become a total bum hole of a market filled with
       scams and LEO‚Ä¶ which is unfortunate.
       I strongly recommend you stay away from DM. I will be setting up
       shop on another market.
       Currently I am preparing to start on HANSA market. It has a fresh
       clean feel to it with attentive staff and multi-signature
       transactions which I‚Äôm in the process of learning how to use.
       I will leave an announcement when my participation at HANSA is
       official.
       TY!

       [21]MUSHBUD
       Keymaster
       I would like to verify that [22]mushbud@protonmail.com is indeed
       myself, and it will soon become my preferred means of email
       communication.
       Protonmail.com is a free, secure & fully encrypted email service
       being hosted out of Switzerland, done so with the fullest intent to
       avoid NSA and USA Government intervention with protection under
       Swiss privacy rights.
       I highly recommend you consider getting yourself an account!
       I am migrating to Protonmail.com for a couple reason:
       Reliability/Longevity, but also due to the fact that I will soon
       upgrade my PGP Key to the newer ‚ÄúRSA 4096 Bits‚Äù.
       When I create the new PGP Key, I will use
       [23]mushbud@protonmail.com
       My old PGP Key uses email address: [24]mushbud@tormail.org
       This is an email address that I no longer have access to, due to
       tormail.org being seized by the FBI Several years ago.
       Using protonmail.com will help ensure that my correct email contact
       will remain functional in this new PGP Key for some time to come.
       I will update once the new PGP Key has been created. I will allow
       both the old and new PGP Key to be used for some time to come,
       until it‚Äôs clear that all customers are comfortable with the
       change. Thanks for your attention!

       2 announcements to make in this post.
       First: Proton Mail now has a hidden service access point. You can
       read your protonmail through TOR at this URL:
       [27]https://protonirockerxow.onion You can verify this link
       yourself by reading the Protonmail Blog at the official protonmail
       site.
       Second: I will now be using [28]MUSHBUD@protonmail.com as my main
       Email contact. This is due to Sigaint.org going offline earlier
       this week and not returning. It would also seem there is some fishy
       business behind the scenes with their other associated projects.
       I‚Äôll be writing more about this in another announcement thread.

       Hey Guys.
       I have added a second, more secure PGP Key (RSA 4096 Bits) to my
       PGP Key page located here:
       [23]Link to both my PGP Keys.
       My old key is not compromised. I have created an additional key as
       a requirement in order to vend on the popular forum site: ‚Äú[24]The
       Hub‚Äú. The Hub requires a minimum of a RSA 4096 in order to vend,
       where my old key was RSA 2048.
       My new key contains [25]mushbud@protonmail.com as the email
       contact, as well it provides the true .Onion URL to this site to
       help you sniff out scammers.
       Feel free to use either the New or Old key, I will leave the choice
       up to you.

       Hi Mushbud,
       I sent you the exact amount right after I order using the Android
       App called Bither but somehow It still unconfirmed. And I really
       cannot cancel the transaction since its already on the blockchain.
       So if you know anyway to solve this problem please lemme know. Im
       in love with your product man. Thanks.

       Hey there.
       My wallet reports no outstanding payment waiting confirmation to
       the address associated with your order, but when I use
       blockchain.info I can see that your payment is there waiting for
       confirmation on the blockchain.
       The BTC blockchain is approaching nearly 200,090 delayed
       transactions due to insufficient transfer fee being used.
       I‚Äôve moved your order from Canceled to ‚Äúon hold‚Äù so that I can
       manually check on it. It may be several days before the transaction
       finally confirms. Once it has, I will proceed to fulfill your
       order.
       There is a software wallet available (but I forget which, maybe
       electrum) that will allow people to send additional transfer fee to
       transactions that are ‚Äústuck‚Äù in the que. You may want to
       investigate that to speed up the process.
       When payments like this are stuck in que, it is very easy to double
       spend the amount which has happened to me now on 2 occasions, so I
       must wait for confirmations to be complete before processing.
       I‚Äôm investigating the possibility of using another crypto at my
       site due to situations like this. If the transfer fee that was used
       is very low, please consider sourcing the wallet that allows you to
       make additional fee payment. I will look myself today and make a
       post this weekend when I‚Äôve found it.
       Sorry for the delays‚Ä¶ but this is the BTC we can expect now =(

       yes. I do understand the circumstance. I use Armory most of the
       time but this time I tested out the Bither app and I wont use it
       again for these kind of transaction. Last time I encountered this
       problem, it took 3 days to confirm. So yeah please, give it
       time.next time I will send with highest fee possible.
       You have a amazing product, mate.Please keep it up and help this
       society expands its consciousness. Peace out!

       Keymaster
       This post is to inform my customers that I have now begun to sell
       my 10G offering at the HANSA Market that you can visit at this URL:
       [23]http://hansamkt2rr6nfg3.onion/
       I am selling (of course) as MUSHBUD
       You can purchase my 10G PE from HANSA with Full Escrow. Search
       MUSHBUD inside HANSA to quickly find me.
       HANSA is a modern market using multisig BTC to help prevent
       Marketplace exit scams. It has a wonderful layout with fast speeds.
       It really should be the #1 market in my mind, but people cling to
       what they are familiar with at Alpha bay.
       I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until people make the switch to
       HANSA, and I‚Äôm happy to be serving you there now.
       Thanks for your attention!

       Earlier this week Sigaint.org (my primary email service) went
       offline. After doing a little digging for information (a lot of
       which you can find on reddit.com). It would appear that there is a
       very good chance they are either seized or doing an exit (scam?).
       There is still the possibility that they are having technical
       difficulty‚Ä¶ but strange behavior in their other projects, and a
       complete silence from the Sigaint administration has most people
       thinking they may be gone for good.
       As a result of this, I will now be using [23]mushbud@protonmail.com
       as my new primary email account.
       Please DO NOT send email to [24]mushbud@sigaint.org
       If Sigaint returns at some point in the future with an explanation
       as to what has happened‚Ä¶ I will use the service again as a backup‚Ä¶
       but let‚Äôs now please use [25]mushbud@protonmail.com as my primary.
       I have no way of retrieving email from sigaint.org, so if you have
       sent me a message in the past few days that did not receive a
       reply, please send that message again to [26]mushbud@protonmail.com

       Mushbud was professional and responded to messages pronto. In
       regards to his shipping policy, beware of the chance of it not
       coming within the allotted time frame. I thought maybe since I live
       on the east coast it wouldn‚Äôt take as long but it has been over 20
       days and I have yet to receive my order. I hope they are worth it,
       if they ever arrive.

       7-12 days is the typical time it takes, until it is not. More info
       available by selecting ‚Äúmy shipping‚Äù on the site menua. Some packs
       will be late, never really any reason for it that I have been able
       to detect‚Ä¶ just some take their sweet time getting there.

       [22]MUSHBUD
       Keymaster
       Hey Guys.
       Many (if not most of you), will know me from The Silk Road, SR2 &
       Agora. You know that I‚Äôve worked hard towards the reputation I‚Äôve
       gained amongst yourselves. Unfortunately‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a bit of an ‚Äúunknown‚Äù
       now amongst many new customers.
       I‚Äôve in the past gained thousands of glowing 5 star reviews (which
       I appreciate!)‚Ä¶ but they have all been lost to history thanks to
       Seizures and Exit Scams.
       I‚Äôd like to request, that once you‚Äôve purchased a product from my
       site, please consider leaving me a Review not only here on the site
       but also at [23]Grams.
       Grams charges a 0.01 entry fee but this fee is returned to you (at
       least it was to me) through their mixing service. Grams will become
       a more permanent resource for Vendor reviews. The likely hood of
       their service being seized is low as they don‚Äôt offer any illegal
       services, there‚Äôs no interest in removing them nor Grams exit
       scamming.
       When you leave a review here on the MUSHBUD site, please know that
       you can leave the review in 2 places. One in the product
       description (which is my preference) and another here in the
       [24]Review forum.
       If you really love the service I provide, please also consider
       leaving a review on Reddit.com at [25]/r/DarkNetMarkets Please
       include my site URL with the review, that would make you super!
       You can now review my products in my official thread on [26]TMG
       Let me just say that I appreciate a good customer, just as much as
       you appreciate a good Vendor‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs keep this ride going‚Ä¶together!

       [22]MUSHBUD
       Keymaster
       I‚Äôm pleased to announce my inclusion in the Vendor Shop list at
       DeepDotWeb.
       You can view my link at this url:
       [23]http://deepdot35wvmeyd5.onion/marketplace-directory/listing/mus
       hbud/
       I‚Äôd like to ask my customers if they‚Äôd please take a moment to
       leave a review for me at DeepDotWeb by using the link above.
       As a token of my gratitude, I will reward DeepDotWeb Reviewers with
       a Coupon good for $5 off your next order.
       To receive the coupon, contact me via email before leaving the
       review. Please inform me which user name you will be leaving the
       review as. I will then email back with the coupon once the review
       is visible.
       This coupon is good for one use, and can not be combined with other
       coupon rewards. [DEL: I will set a 30 Day expiration on the coupon.
       :DEL]
       I am amending this, I will no longer set expiration date. The
       coupon will never expire, and can be redeemed 1 time for the
       duration of my private shop. You won‚Äôt be obligated to make your
       purchase immediately.
       This offer is open to any customer who has in fact placed an order
       with MUSHBUD at some time in the past. If you are new, please wait
       to receive your product before creating the review.
       DeepDotWeb is a trusted (and most popular) news & information
       source for the DarkNet Scene.
       DeepDotWeb contains many guides and links to important resources,
       markets & vendors who do business on the DarkNet.
       I‚Äôm happy to have been accepted on their site!
       Thanks for your attention.

       It‚Äôs sad, but the scam site The DrugMarket is still actively
       scamming people, and there is a fake MUSHBUD listing on this site.
       Please Please, always use some source of verification when unsure
       about your next purchase with a Vendor.
       Have them Verify their authenticity either with PGP, a well known
       email address, their forum/reddit presence etc‚Ä¶ a few moments of
       your time can help prevent the sting of losing hard earned $ to a
       proxied anonymous twat (that will surely burn in hell if I have
       something to say about it).
       This site has been up and actively scamming people since about the
       end of SR2 & Agora. There were more then a Dozen shady sites that
       popped up about that time‚Ä¶ this one had been completely bogus from
       the get go.
       There is no way to become an active vendor on the site. The Vendor
       names and listings are 100% fake, all listings have been pulled
       from SR2 & Agora‚Ä¶ all payments go directly to the pocket of the
       site owner.
       I had thought this site finally dead, but I had a customer recently
       contact me about a missing shipment from an order placed on The
       DrugMarket.
       I feel it necessary to warn people to stay away from this trap, and
       please always make contact with your Vendor if you‚Äôre uncertain!

   Wed, 24 May 2017 09:13:54 +0000 MUSHBUD <p>This post is to inform my
   customers that I have now begun to sell my 10G offering at the HANSA
   Market that you can visit at this URL: <a
   href="http://hansamkt2rr6nfg3.onion/" target="_blank"
   rel="nofollow">http://hansamkt2rr6nfg3.onion/</a></p> <p>I am selling
   (of course) as MUSHBUD</p> <p>You can purchase my 10G PE from HANSA
   with Full Escrow. Search MUSHBUD inside HANSA to quickly find me.</p>
   <p>HANSA is a modern market using multisig BTC to help prevent
   Marketplace exit scams. It has a wonderful layout with fast speeds.
   </p> <p>It really should be the #1 market in my mind, but people cling
   to what they are familiar with at Alpha bay.</p> <p>I think it&#8217;s
   only a matter of time until people make the switch to HANSA, and
   I&#8217;m happy to be serving you there now.</p> <p>Thanks for your
   attention!</p>

   28 Thu, 23 Feb 2017 07:13:37 +0000 MUSHBUD <p>It&#8217;s sad, but the
   scam site <strong>The DrugMarket</strong> is still actively scamming
   people, and there is a fake MUSHBUD listing on this site. Please
   Please, always use some source of verification when unsure about your
   next purchase with a Vendor.</p> <p>Have them Verify their authenticity
   either with PGP, a well known email address, their forum/reddit
   presence etc&#8230; a few moments of your time can help prevent the
   sting of losing hard earned $ to a proxied anonymous twat (that will
   surely burn in hell if I have something to say about it).</p> <p>This
   site has been up and actively scamming people since about the end of
   SR2 &#038; Agora. There were more then a Dozen shady sites that popped
   up about that time&#8230; this one had been completely bogus from the
   get go.</p> <p>There is no way to become an active vendor on the site.
   The Vendor names and listings are 100% fake, all listings have been
   pulled from SR2 &#038; Agora&#8230; all payments go directly to the
   pocket of the site owner.</p> <p>I had thought this site finally dead,
   but I had a customer recently contact me about a missing shipment from
   an order placed on The DrugMarket. </p> <p>I feel it necessary to warn
   people to stay away from this trap, and please always make contact with
   your Vendor if you&#8217;re uncertain!</p>

   e-out/#post-992 Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:37:26 +0000 MUSHBUD <p>Earlier this
   week Sigaint.org (my primary email service) went offline. After doing a
   little digging for information (a lot of which you can find on
   reddit.com). It would appear that there is a very good chance they are
   either seized or doing an exit (scam?). </p> <p>There is still the
   possibility that they are having technical difficulty&#8230; but
   strange behavior in their other projects, and a complete silence from
   the Sigaint administration has most people thinking they may be gone
   for good.</p> <p>As a result of this, I will now be using <strong><a
   href="mailto:mushbud@protonmail.com"
   rel="nofollow">mushbud@protonmail.com</a></strong> as my new primary
   email account.</p> <p><em>Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> send email to
   <a href="mailto:mushbud@sigaint.org"
   rel="nofollow">mushbud@sigaint.org</a></em></p> <p>If Sigaint returns
   at some point in the future with an explanation as to what has
   happened&#8230; I will use the service again as a backup&#8230; but
   let&#8217;s now please use <a href="mailto:mushbud@protonmail.com"
   rel="nofollow">mushbud@protonmail.com</a> as my primary.</p> <p>I have
   no way of retrieving email from sigaint.org, so if you have sent me a
   message in the past few days that did not receive a reply, please send
   that message again to <strong><a href="mailto:mushbud@protonmail.com"

   991 Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:25:16 +0000 MUSHBUD <p>2 announcements to make
   in this post.</p> <p>First: Proton Mail now has a hidden service access
   point. You can read your protonmail through TOR at this URL: <a
   href="https://protonirockerxow.onion"
   rel="nofollow">https://protonirockerxow.onion</a> You can verify this
   link yourself by reading the Protonmail Blog at the official protonmail
   site.</p> <p>Second: I will now be using <a
   href="mailto:MUSHBUD@protonmail.com"
   rel="nofollow">MUSHBUD@protonmail.com</a> as my main Email contact.
   This is due to Sigaint.org going offline earlier this week and not
   returning. It would also seem there is some fishy business behind the
   scenes with their other associated projects.</p> <p>I&#8217;ll be
   writing more about this in another announcement thread. </p>

   t-924 Thu, 26 Jan 2017 05:52:17 +0000 MUSHBUD <p>Hey Guys.</p> <p>After
   visiting several Vendor forums, it&#8217;s beginning to look like Dream
   Market has become a total bum hole of a market filled with scams and
   LEO&#8230; which is unfortunate.</p> <p>I strongly recommend you stay
   away from DM. I will be setting up shop on another market. </p>
   <p>Currently I am preparing to start on HANSA market. It has a fresh
   clean feel to it with attentive staff and multi-signature transactions
   which I&#8217;m in the process of learning how to use.</p> <p>I will
   leave an announcement when my participation at HANSA is official.</p>

   t-889 Fri, 13 Jan 2017 10:28:50 +0000 MUSHBUD <p>This is a verification
   announcement that the MUSHBUD found at Dream Market, is in fact
   myself.<br /> <strong>You will</strong> receive your product if
   purchased from MUSHBUD on DM.</p> <p>You can visit DM here: <a
   href="http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/?ai=242002" target="_blank"
   rel="nofollow">DREAM MARKET</a></p> <p>I think it may be the oldest
   market still in existence, It definitely has that old school feel which
   I&#8217;m a fan of, and one of the reasons I&#8217;ve opened a shop
   there.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a bit chaotic in there right now, and you
   probably won&#8217;t find my offerings by just browsing. So search
   MUSHBUD on the site and you will find me.</p> <p>I will only offer my
   10G on other markets. Anything larger will have to be purchased here on
   my own site.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve opened the DM shop to alleviate any
   doubts that some new customers may have about MUSHBUD. You can now
   purchase my 10G worry free with full ESCROW on DM.</p>

   added a second, more secure PGP Key (RSA 4096 Bits) to my PGP Key page
   located here:<br /> <a
   href="http://kpj3orlxmfs6yqah.onion/mushbud-pgp-key/"
   rel="nofollow">Link to both my PGP Keys.</a></p> <p>My old key is not
   compromised. I have created an additional key as a requirement in order
   to vend on the popular forum site: &#8220;<a
   href="http://thehub7gqe43miyc.onion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The
   Hub</a>&#8220;. The Hub requires a minimum of a RSA 4096 in order to
   vend, where my old key was RSA 2048.</p> <p>My new key contains <a
   href="mailto:mushbud@protonmail.com"
   rel="nofollow">mushbud@protonmail.com</a> as the email contact, as well
   it provides the true .Onion URL to this site to help you sniff out
   scammers.</p> <p>Feel free to use either the New or Old key, I will
   leave the choice up to you.</p>

   that <a href="mailto:mushbud@protonmail.com"
   rel="nofollow">mushbud@protonmail.com</a> is indeed myself, and it will
   soon become my preferred means of email communication.</p>
   <p>Protonmail.com is a free, secure &#038; fully encrypted email
   service being hosted out of Switzerland, done so with the fullest
   intent to avoid NSA and USA Government intervention with protection
   under Swiss privacy rights.</p> <p>I highly recommend you consider
   getting yourself an account!</p> <p>I am migrating to Protonmail.com
   for a couple reason: Reliability/Longevity, but also due to the fact
   that I will soon upgrade my PGP Key to the newer &#8220;RSA 4096
   Bits&#8221;.</p> <p>When I create the new PGP Key, I will use <a
   href="mailto:mushbud@protonmail.com"
   rel="nofollow">mushbud@protonmail.com</a></p> <p>My old PGP Key uses
   email address: <a href="mailto:mushbud@tormail.org"
   rel="nofollow">mushbud@tormail.org</a><br /> This is an email address
   that I no longer have access to, due to tormail.org being seized by the
   FBI Several years ago.</p> <p>Using protonmail.com will help ensure
   that my correct email contact will remain functional in this new PGP
   Key for some time to come.</p> <p>I will update once the new PGP Key
   has been created. I will allow both the old and new PGP Key to be used
   for some time to come, until it&#8217;s clear that all customers are
   comfortable with the change. Thanks for your attention!</p>

[16]DOSAGE: Basic Guidelines for Dosing PE.

    [17]Informational  [18]Add comments
   Jan 082016

   PE is Strong, I‚Äôm not just saying that because I sell them!  You‚Äôll
   experience this for yourself. I do recommend taking less of PE then you
   would a typical shroom sold on the street, at least for your first
   time. It‚Äôs important to get a feel for them, before you go on an all
   out vision quest.

   People‚Äôs tolerances can vary widely. The following is recommendation
   based off of my own use, and discussions I‚Äôve had with my customers
   over the years.

   DOSAGE:

   .5 Gram is a good euphoric dose, and is often the amount fitted inside
   a size 00 Gel Capsule. This is a dose that lifts the mood‚Ä¶ you can feel
   that you‚Äôve taken something, but you could still easily go out,
   drink/dance and feel your spirits lifted. I don‚Äôt recommend going over
   this, and expecting to be fully functional in public.
     __________________________________________________________________

     The following doses are based on the expectation that you are
     following the protocols for good tripping as described in the ‚Äúhow
     to consume‚Äù guide. (my next project, I‚Äôll post this soon).
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Gram is where things become‚Ä¶ mushroomy (is there really any other way
   to describe it? :) ).  This is the dose I use to test my product. It
   gives you a run through the mushroom spectrum, without it completely
   overpowering your state of mind.

   It comes on in about 20-30 Minutes, reaching a peak at about an hour
   and half with a playful lingering that can last another 4-5 hours.

   My trips at 1G are usually pretty calm, I can go about my duties
   getting work done while listening to music.

   Colors become more vivid, tastes become tastier, music sounds splendid.
   Overall an enjoyable experience.

   I rarely feel any dark energy at 1G, you can expect yourself to
   function mostly normally.

   I wouldn‚Äôt try and do this dose at work and expect to get away with it‚Ä¶
   but a walk downtown, visit the art gallery, sunning at the beach,
   watching a movie‚Ä¶ This is a good dose to liven up those activities, and
   possibly feel a profound insight from the experiences you are having.

   Scaling up from 1G should be tailored to your own chemistry, perhaps
   1.5G is what you need to feel as I do on 1G.   2G opens up new
   doors/higher levels.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Grams, and you can begin to sense the presence of Divinity. It‚Äôs a
   mixed bag dose‚Ä¶ I have often enough sailed through a 2 Gram dose
   without much in the way of new experience, but always a feeling of
   pleasure or profound importance.

   Time will begin to morph at this dose. Gaps in time / spaciness will
   emerge while you try and concentrate/focus . For a new user, this is
   where things could become dark.

   When you hear the phrase ‚Äúlet yourself go‚Äù, this is the mind space
   being talked about. It is better to learn to work with this energy,
   then it is to fight against it.  Inflicting your will on the trip, can
   make things go sideways.  Be with the trip not against it.

   Keep yourself calm, if you need to rationalize, remember that you have
   only just consumed the safest psychedelic on the planet, and the trip
   will eventually end.

   Nervous energies can form, while you ‚Äúexperience yourself experiencing
   mushrooms‚Äù (maybe for the first time) This is often where people may
   react badly to their shrooms.  Sensing this shift in consciousness‚Ä¶
   they feel overpowered.

     An animalistic impulse is to purge the contents of the stomach in
     the hopes to feel better. If need be, provide yourself that relief‚Ä¶
     but remember your crazy shamanistic ancestry and how this would be
     frowned on! Be brave üòõ

   After some experience, a 2 Gram dose will likely become your ‚Äúgo to‚Äù
   dose.

   2G almost always for me starts out CHAOTIC, I sense myself sending and
   receiving information through dimensional portals. I can close my eyes,
   and meditate on colors that come to life, and exhibit a will of their
   own. When you work through your dark energy you will begin to approach
   something I can only call ‚ÄúGlow‚Äù.

   Glow for me, is an overwhelming sense of well being.  It‚Äôs like poetry
   in motion, it‚Äôs the spark of creativity‚Ä¶ it is the first feelings of
   understanding.  It is when the world begins to intuitively make sense,
   without the need for words and with perfect realization‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm always
   looking for Glow! =) it is a treat for the brave!

   That being said, often glow comes only to those willing for the ‚ÄúHeroic
   Dose‚Äù as Terance Mckenna would phrase it. (an excellent man that you
   should all know!)
     __________________________________________________________________

   3.5 Grams (a Heroic Dose) Is a popular dose in the Mushroom world. It‚Äôs
   been a standby dose you can recommend to anyone, knowing that‚Ä¶ ok it
   might be a bit much for them, but we all know they‚Äôll survive (provided
   they don‚Äôt lose their mind to fear, or maybe injure themselves from a
   lack of fear.  No jumping off of roofs believing you can fly please!).

     3.5G is more then safe chemically speaking, but this begins a dose
     size that could have you ‚Äúlose yourself‚Äù for a spell.

   People who recommend you do mushrooms, want you to understand the
   ‚Äúdepth‚Äù of the experience. The previous doses recommended, may not
   provide that depth. This is why so many will recommend 3.5G, so that
   you ‚Äúget there‚Äù and know it for what it is.

   Ego Deaths have and will continue for some at this level. Personally I
   have not had Ego Death at 3.5G, but I know many that have. I have a few
   tails told of Stomach Pumps at the hospital at 3.5G. This is why I
   recommend you know PE, don‚Äôt be to big and mighty!

     Mushrooms have never really been a ‚Äúparty drug‚Äù and they should
     never be considered that at this high a dose.

   3.5G and above, you really should be meditating in a tranquil spot,
   with no expectations to be any good to anyone, and if you‚Äôre
   inexperienced you should be with someone (who is not on anything),
   watching over you.

   There will be Chaos! There will be alien artifacts & visitation through
   unseen portals! you will not have a choice in the matter.

   Mushrooms will own you for the next 4-8 hours. You will be subject to
   what the mushrooms want to show you, not what you want to show
   mushrooms.  Absolutely do not attempt to drive or do anything that puts
   others in danger!

   This dose will drag you through the dirt, until you learn to behave! If
   you are trying to stand up raging, howling mad cursing your enemies!
   You will have a bad time man! sit back down.

   3.5G is going to learn you, (real quick) that the only way to
   enlightenment is through peaceful cohabitation with the other energies.

   The Chaos of Life/Death, Up/Down, Left/Right, On/Off right/wrong
   yin/yang‚Ä¶ decisions, the perception of time will spin faster and faster
   and faster until it finally shatters in to a sweet unconscious release
   of divinity.

     This is ego death‚Ä¶ and this is subject to personal interpretation‚Ä¶
     and this is why we invented conversation. (both consciously and
     subconsciously)

   It can be scary first time, and the more you learn to let go, the
   sweeter the final reward‚Ä¶ after you climb the mountain, there is the
   kindest most loving glow imaginable that walks you down the path and
   back to earth.  Do not take your earth mother for granted!

   It has never betrayed me! On my roughest/wildest adventures, it has
   always carried me home. These truly are spirit molecules, and the
   language of Gods!
     __________________________________________________________________

   5 Grams is my Ego Death dose. It can go one of two ways for me at this
   dose, ‚Äúreally good‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù. (but not so much really bad anymore, I‚Äôve
   learned to talk myself down)

   If good, it‚Äôs an indescribable feeling of wave after wave breaking
   against the shoreline of self. You can feel suddenly lifted from body,
   and transported to the astral realms. I often detect myself
   communicating with loved ones I‚Äôve lost, picturesque settings will form
   from light acting as if molecules re arranged for my own experience.
   You feel compelled to BEHOLD!

   If it goes bad, if I were to Video Record myself at this dose, you
   would see a wild monstrosity, squirming and writhing on the floor (on
   the floor because there‚Äôs no way I could stand or even sit up)

   I‚Äôm usually on my knees begging for forgiveness for what I‚Äôve just
   begun.  I feel The Mighty Hammer of judgment striking my skull until it
   finally cracks, and I ooze on to the carpet‚Ä¶ and the ooze is good :)
   Unfortunately this can take hours, that feel like an eternity.

   It is an oooh so uncomfortable feeling ‚Äúfor me‚Äù this high, to go bad‚Ä¶
   but the absolutely mind boggling nature of all things existing at once
   becomes so clear.  There is knowledge and character strengthening even
   in the worst of trips.  What doesn‚Äôt kill you makes your stronger (or
   insane) üòõ

     ME on a bad trip

     I have to go back now, I have to go back now! please let me down,
     please let me down, yes YES!  here it is, here is my body, finally
     rest‚Ä¶ finally I can rest. There‚Äôs my embarrassing truth, I‚Äôll take
     it! it‚Äôs mine to love, it is the truth of me.

   In my bad trips, I can feel a kind of ‚Äútrickery‚Äù taking place.  I feel
   attempts being made by less then friendly entities trying to coerce my
   subconscious into believing lies‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still uncertain to me their
   function in nature.

   If you seek balance, you will receive balance.  If you seek good you
   will find good.  If you seek evil, you will find evil. positivity for
   positivity / negativity for negativity.

   I don‚Äôt do doses this high any more, they were a novelty at first, but
   now I am content to reach glow‚Ä¶ without the shattering voice of god
   echoing truth in my mind!

   Anything above this level, I wish you the best! be safe, and you really
   should know what you are doing!

   use and personal experience. Please feel free to enlighten us in the

            You‚Äôre such a friendly vendor and the information your provide
            is invaluable for the community. I am surprised more people
            don‚Äôt return the favor of communication! Recently ordered a
            30g pack and can‚Äôt wait for its arrival, cheers.

[17]CONSUMING: Preparation for a good trip.

    [18]Informational  [19]Add comments
   Jan 112016

   The products I sell come as powder for stealth primarily, but this has
   made things more convenient/advantageous for the customer in several
   ways.  I will discuss my favorite ingestion methods, and some of the
   perks of grinding your mushrooms to powder.

   Powdered shroomies can be easier to ingest, with less gag reflex (if
   done correctly, more on that later in this article).  Being pleasant to
   ingest helps smooth you in to ‚Äúthe groove‚Äù, rather then grimacing over
   taste and texture of a dried version, of something many people already
   pick off of their dinner plate!

     This ‚ÄúYuck‚Äù factor is often what creates a queasy feeling that can
     result in over reaction, and vomiting.

   It‚Äôs a belief that grinding shrooms to powder helps to increase the
   digestible ‚ÄúSurface Area‚Äù, essentially increasing the available
   particulate in your system, allowing for more of the ‚Äúactives‚Äù to reach
   the bloodstream during digestion‚Ä¶ and possibly resulting in a stronger
   trip.

   Mushrooms are known to be hard to digest when raw.  They are made of
   Chitin, a polysaccharide and essentially the same substance that insect
   and shellfish exoskeletons are constructed of.  If you wolf down large
   pieces of psychedelic mushroom, to avoid the taste and texture‚Ä¶ you may
   not be getting your money‚Äôs worth.

   Grinding to powder helps with the digestion, it helps masquerade the
   taste and texture and allows you these three most popular ingestion
   methods (ordered by my preference).
    1. LemonTek
    2. Capsules
    3. Tea

   LemonTek is my #1 recommendation.  Before I explain it‚Äôs preparation
   (which is very simple), let‚Äôs cover what it is ‚Äúsuppose‚Äù to be doing.

   It is believed that the acid in your lemon juice is pre-converting the
   psilocybin in to psilocin.  This helps to expedite the on set of the
   trip, regardless of of whether the effects are illusion or not‚Ä¶ there
   is a feeling of a harder hitting rush and increased potency.

   On top of this benefit is the incredible ‚Äúmasking‚Äù ability of the
   sour/tart in your lemon juice.  It quite easily masks the taste of your
   shrooms, and converts the dried powder in to a slurry which is much
   easier to swallow.

   Preparation is easy and will take 25 minutes or less:

   You will need a couple fresh lemons, or you could substitute with
   authentic fresh squeezed lemon juice such as the kind found in those
   plastic squeeze lemons (I believe there is also a bottled BBQ/Marinade
   version).  Limes will probably work equally as well.  Any citrus fruit
   may work, but I don‚Äôt have personal experience (a sour grapefruit comes
   to mind).

   A small glass (shot-glass is good) and 1 glass water/fruit juice as a
   chaser.

   Measure out the shroom dose you‚Äôre planning to take, and put that in
   your empty glass.  When adding liquid we want to create at first a
   paste, followed by a sludge and finally a slurry stirring between each.

   Squeezing your lemons before hand will be helpful.  It helps if your
   lemons or juice are at room temp.

   Slowly begin to add juice to the powder until it looks (just ever so
   barely) absorbed.  Give it a little stir.  Add a little more juice and
   it should become a liqduidy glob.  Give it another stir.  Finish up
   with as much juice as you desire (remember you‚Äôll be drinking this!)

   At this point, if the sour/tart nature of lemons is unappealing to your
   buds, you could add a spoon full of honey or sugar (stir until
   dissolved).

   Let the concoction sit for 10-20 minutes (not much longer).

   Knock back your creation (sip if you prefer), and wash down with the
   chaser you had on hand.

     Please consume the remnants, any particles that remain in your glass
     will contain actives.  Disposing of them will be wasteful.  Swirl a
     little water in the glass to get the remainder.

   Done! I do add a bit of sugar to my mix, and I find it pleasant
   enough.  It has a slightly off tasting lemon aid flavor, that doesn‚Äôt
   repulse me in the least.

   For me, LemonTek helps rush me through some of the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù and provides
   me a cleaner/clearer feeling.

   Capsules (Gel Caps) area a trusty stand by for people with nausea
   problems.  They could still produce a gag reflex with people who find
   swallowing larger pills a difficulty.  Typically size 00 and 000 gel
   caps are used for mushies (and they are pretty big).

   You can purchase a capsule making device at an affordable price‚Ä¶
   searching ‚Äúcap-m-quik‚Äù on google will lead you to many sources.  You
   will want one that includes the TAMPER accessory.

   This isn‚Äôt a particularly convenient way to consume considering the
   effort involved in their creation.

   It may be necessary
     * If you are reselling, most people will not want powder in a bag.
     * For travel convenience (put them inside a vitamin container labeled
       as a herbal remedy).
     * For smuggling in to events, they can be hidden easily, and not
       easily identified (they could be your diet aid/ lactose agent etc)
     * The capsules offer a fairly decent air seal, and provide longevity
       outside of the original shipping container‚Ä¶ this may be your best
       option to have your shrooms ‚Äúout and about‚Äù with you.

   When consuming capsules, it‚Äôs important they are taken on an empty
   stomach.  Having a full belly is going to severely effect your trip.  (
   I discuss this a bit further down).

   Tea Preparation, I am not a big fan and do not recommend this to anyone
   who would like to ‚ÄúTrip Balls‚Äù (as it were).  This technique is most
   often used to feel the ‚Äúmellow‚Äù highs of mushrooms.  It is definitely
   the most pleasant way to consume your shroomies, and I would be
   surprised to hear reports of any nausea.

   If gag reflex/nausea are preventing you from trying mushrooms, then Tea
   is the choice you should make.

   It is a very straight forward process with a couple caveats.

   You will need a small pot with lid, a fine strainer, a cup/mug and your
   favorite flavor teabag.

   Measure out your dose.  For the beginner I recommend 750mg (this will
   be a very light trip).  For the experienced user, I suggest more then
   you would typically take as a whole mushroom‚Ä¶ ie your dose +250mg
   (maybe +350mg).  This is with the assumption you will dispose of the
   mushroom grounds rather then eat them.

   Fill your cup/mug to the brim with water and add to the pot, put the
   lid on the pot and bring to boil.  Once at rapid boil remove from heat,
   add the mushrooms and stir until settled.  Add your teabag, place lid
   back on and steep for 5-10 minutes.

   Stir and pour through strainer, push out any extra liquid in your
   teabag & mushroom grounds by pushing down on the teabag as it lays on
   the mushroom grounds inside the strainer.

   Add milk and sugar to your liking

   Done!  Tastes good.  Just to be certain, use a tea that‚Äôs not too
   delicate in flavor.

   Psilocybin/Psilocin are delicate crystals, we don‚Äôt want to boil the
   hell out of them!  We don‚Äôt want any excessive oxidization (if we can
   help it) and there usually is to a degree some loss of potency.

   You will not acquire all ‚Äúactives‚Äù with this method, some will be left
   behind and disposed of.  Experimentation will be required to find your
   sweet spot.  You will likely need to use more product then if consumed
   by an alternative method such as LemonTek.

   Other Methods I absolutely do not support methods like ‚Äúpeanut butter
   sandwich‚Äù and ‚ÄúChocolate milkshake‚Äù etc.  It is very important that if
   you intend to reach the ‚ÄúTripping Balls‚Äù levels, that you follow proper
   fasting and empty stomach protocol.

   Sure you could reach ‚Äútripping balls‚Äù by wolfing down 4grams after
   Sunday dinner, but why do that when 2 grams will do the same on an
   empty stomach?

   Proper Fasting Protocols.

   Any experienced Mushroom head will recommend the same. It is just fact
   that a clean digestive system, free of any recent meals and restricted
   liquid allowance‚Ä¶ will produce a trip and experience far greater then
   one where the protocols are neglected.

   You should use 3+ hours without food, as a very basic suggestion. 12+
   hours would be a better place for people to start when doing spiritual
   work.  Lets not forget that our shaman forefathers often fasted for up
   to a week on water alone before their ritualistic use.

   If you wish to reach their plane(s) of existence, you will need to
   follow their rules.  Shamans offer themselves up as vessels to the
   spirit realm, to be possessed by and experienced through the use of a
   catalyst.

   It is a real thing, it is happening everywhere and always.

   Some people will not want these visitations.  Often when things get to
   moody, to dark and feel like they are getting out of hand‚Ä¶ you may want
   to begin eating.

     I have found in this circumstance that drinking milk helps bring me
     back to ease.  This is a reason why I do not suggest using Milk or
     Dairy products to begin your trip.  To me it seems counter
     intuitive, as much as tripping on a full stomach.

   Other Protocols.

   Equally as important to your physiological preparations, are your
   environmental and psychological preparations.

   Some people looove to ‚Äúfear and loath‚Äù trip, any place any time‚Ä¶ life
   is a party! The weirder the better, ‚Äúwhere the freaks at?‚Äù .  If this
   does not appeal to you, then you should remove yourself from the
   company of these trippers.  They will be tripping Darkness.  I‚Äôve been
   there myself.  It is exciting, but when it goes dark it can be
   overwhelming‚Ä¶ approaching terrifying‚Ä¶ So many flashbacks üòâ

   If you find enlightenment more appealing, mushrooms can sing your song
   every time by removing these vexation before hand.  Be at a calm and
   meditative state hours previous to consuming your dose.  Do not burden
   your high mind with thoughts of ‚Äúthings you must do‚Äù. Take the rest of
   the day off specifically to trip.

   Ensure that you are in a place that no one can just ‚Äúpop by‚Äù and
   interrupt your trip.  Make the people you must coexist with aware that
   you are on mushrooms and have begun to trip.  Full disclosure feels
   good if you can afford to‚Ä¶

   It is good to focus your train of thought on something positive.  If
   you are at home, surround yourself with trigger objects that reflect
   your happy memories.  If you are a music fan, I suggest something
   instrumental without too many lyrical layers‚Ä¶ unless of course you wish
   a more intimate relationship with your favorite artists.

   Nothing feels better then a secure spot, outside on a warm summers
   evening.  Under the stars with the sounds of small animals scurrying,
   the wind wafting sweet smells of plant life‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs almost as if we were
   born to a planet earth‚Ä¶ and not to a diabolical economic war machine
   hell bent on destruction and total control.

   I hope you find this writing helpful and informative!  Please feel free
   to ask your questions in the comments below‚Ä¶ and by all means please
   enlighten us with your own recommendations‚Ä¶ This is how we grow!

   Hello People.

   I‚Äôve just completed a major harvest, and had a pretty good yield.  I
   have everything drying now, and expect that it will take 4 days for all
   of it to be cracker dry‚Ä¶ I will then grind and prepare 100% of it in to
   60G.

   So, we‚Äôre looking at next weekend, Nov 19th I will add the stock to the
   site.

   There are still a Ton of 10G in stock‚Ä¶ 30G is going to be out of stock
   towards the end of the month, but I should have a small harvest coming
   in at about that time to replenish.

   Thanks!

   Hey Guys.

   It‚Äôs been a funny year, lot‚Äôs of craziness‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm carrying this
   feeling like 2017 is going to be interesting, in an enlightening way.
   Lot‚Äôs of potential for good.  Let the awakening continue!

   I am now on Vacation,  I will return Jan 2.

   I have left the shop operational.  If you place an order during my
   vacation, please know that it will not be fulfilled until I return
   Jan2.  Your order will be added to que, and first come first served.

   I have plenty of stock in all sizes, and I have 2 huge bags of dried
   Mush that I will be grinding some time during my time off, so things
   will be solid during February.

   I‚Äôll see you after the festivity, I hope you and yours have a very
   merry time!  Take care and be safe.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì Products


   What am I selling?

   I sell a special strain of Psilocybe Cubensis named ‚ÄúPenis Envy‚Äù which
   is known in short as (PE). I sell no other strain.  This is a potent
   strain, and with a little research on Google & Reddit, you will find a
   lot of user feedback attesting to it‚Äôs strength.

   I sell a Ground & Prepackaged product.  Currently I offer sizes of
   10/30/60 grams.  I do not offer custom order sizes.  The product is
   ground in to fine powder to conceal it‚Äôs identity, and to produce a
   convincing stealth that must meet strict letter mail dimension‚Ä¶ which
   in turn ensures a very high success rate to nearly every country on the
   planet!
     __________________________________________________________________

     My Shrooms are quality and potent. 100% pure home grown. There is no
     chance of wild mushroom contamination.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì About


   I am the same MUSHBUD that had been servicing the DNM Scene since the
   original Silk Road, as well as SR2, Sheep, BMR, Agora & briefly at
   Abraxas.

   You can verify my PGP  (as well as read hundreds of my positive
   reviews) at GRAMS info Desk.  GRAMS is an independent resource created
   as a contact and verification point of Hundreds of Vendors across
   Dozens of DN Markets.

   I am the same MUSHBUD who has frequented Reddit.com for the past 3+
   years.  I have created my own Sub Reddit which you can now reach at the
   following URL:

   PE is Strong, I‚Äôm not just saying that because I sell them!  You‚Äôll
   experience this for yourself. I do recommend taking less of PE then you
   would a typical shroom sold on the street, at least for your first
   time. It‚Äôs important to get a feel for them, before you go on an all
   out vision quest.

   People‚Äôs tolerances can vary widely. The following is recommendation
   based off of my own use, and discussions I‚Äôve had with my customers
   over the years.

[13]Moving in to March.

   Feb 282017

   Hey Guys.

   I just wrapped up my harvests for February, and committed the remainder
   of what was grown to (60)G as it was nearly sold out.  There‚Äôs another
   25+ (60)G up for sale now.  I expect this supply will last through most
   of March.  There may be a couple weeks where 60G is sold out during
   Late March & Early April.

   My next harvest is scheduled for Mid March‚Ä¶ (10)G are becoming very
   popular again, so I will be committing a majority of March‚Äôs harvests
   to that amount.  I expect the (30)G I have in stock to last until my
   early April Harvests where I will replenish that amount & the (60)G.

   Everything is ticking along nicely, I hope you‚Äôre all doing well.  See
   you in the future!

[17]Jan Stock Supply.

   Jan 072017

   I hope everyone had a great holiday season!

   I‚Äôve just added (90) 30G packs to inventory and another (7) 60G.  Next
   harvest is a small one planned for late Jan, and a large one planned
   for mid Feb.  I still  have Dozens of 10G in stock.

   The Xmas season kept my hands busy with Family, so I‚Äôm a bit behind in
   my work.   I‚Äôll be ramping up my grows again for bigger harvests.  I
   suspect though that the current supply will most likely be enough for
   Jan at current rate of sales.  So no expectations of being sold out
   this month‚Ä¶ early February will be touch and go but March will have big
   yields.

   Thanks again for all the support you‚Äôve shown me over the years, and
   happy new year!

   Hey Guys.

   It‚Äôs been a funny year, lot‚Äôs of craziness‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm carrying this
   feeling like 2017 is going to be interesting, in an enlightening way.
   Lot‚Äôs of potential for good.  Let the awakening continue!

   I am now on Vacation,  I will return Jan 2.

   I have left the shop operational.  If you place an order during my
   vacation, please know that it will not be fulfilled until I return
   Jan2.  Your order will be added to que, and first come first served.

   I have plenty of stock in all sizes, and I have 2 huge bags of dried
   Mush that I will be grinding some time during my time off, so things
   will be solid during February.

   I‚Äôll see you after the festivity, I hope you and yours have a very
   merry time!  Take care and be safe.

   I‚Äôve just added (20) 60G packs to stock, and I should have another 10

   Hello People.

   I‚Äôve just completed a major harvest, and had a pretty good yield.  I
   have everything drying now, and expect that it will take 4 days for all
   of it to be cracker dry‚Ä¶ I will then grind and prepare 100% of it in to
   60G.

   So, we‚Äôre looking at next weekend, Nov 19th I will add the stock to the
   site.

   There are still a Ton of 10G in stock‚Ä¶ 30G is going to be out of stock
   towards the end of the month, but I should have a small harvest coming
   in at about that time to replenish.

   Thanks!

[14]Moving in to March.

    [15]Product Updates  [16]2 Responses ¬ª
   Feb 282017

   Hey Guys.

   I just wrapped up my harvests for February, and committed the remainder
   of what was grown to (60)G as it was nearly sold out.  There‚Äôs another
   25+ (60)G up for sale now.  I expect this supply will last through most
   of March.  There may be a couple weeks where 60G is sold out during
   Late March & Early April.

   My next harvest is scheduled for Mid March‚Ä¶ (10)G are becoming very
   popular again, so I will be committing a majority of March‚Äôs harvests
   to that amount.  I expect the (30)G I have in stock to last until my
   early April Harvests where I will replenish that amount & the (60)G.

   Everything is ticking along nicely, I hope you‚Äôre all doing well.  See
   you in the future!

[18]Jan Stock Supply.

   Jan 072017

   I hope everyone had a great holiday season!

   I‚Äôve just added (90) 30G packs to inventory and another (7) 60G.  Next
   harvest is a small one planned for late Jan, and a large one planned
   for mid Feb.  I still  have Dozens of 10G in stock.

   The Xmas season kept my hands busy with Family, so I‚Äôm a bit behind in
   my work.   I‚Äôll be ramping up my grows again for bigger harvests.  I
   suspect though that the current supply will most likely be enough for
   Jan at current rate of sales.  So no expectations of being sold out
   this month‚Ä¶ early February will be touch and go but March will have big
   yields.

   Thanks again for all the support you‚Äôve shown me over the years, and
   happy new year!

   Hey Guys.

   It‚Äôs been a funny year, lot‚Äôs of craziness‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm carrying this
   feeling like 2017 is going to be interesting, in an enlightening way.
   Lot‚Äôs of potential for good.  Let the awakening continue!

   I am now on Vacation,  I will return Jan 2.

   I have left the shop operational.  If you place an order during my
   vacation, please know that it will not be fulfilled until I return
   Jan2.  Your order will be added to que, and first come first served.

   I have plenty of stock in all sizes, and I have 2 huge bags of dried
   Mush that I will be grinding some time during my time off, so things
   will be solid during February.

   I‚Äôll see you after the festivity, I hope you and yours have a very
   merry time!  Take care and be safe.

   I‚Äôve just added (20) 60G packs to stock, and I should have another 10
   or so added towards the end of the month.

   Next Harvest will be mostly 30G and maybe a dozen or so 60G.

   Nov 132016

   Hello People.

   I‚Äôve just completed a major harvest, and had a pretty good yield.  I
   have everything drying now, and expect that it will take 4 days for all
   of it to be cracker dry‚Ä¶ I will then grind and prepare 100% of it in to
   60G.

   So, we‚Äôre looking at next weekend, Nov 19th I will add the stock to the
   site.

   There are still a Ton of 10G in stock‚Ä¶ 30G is going to be out of stock
   towards the end of the month, but I should have a small harvest coming
   in at about that time to replenish.

   Thanks!

   entirely 60G as promised.  There will be plenty to come!

   Jan 082016

   PE is Strong, I‚Äôm not just saying that because I sell them!  You‚Äôll
   experience this for yourself. I do recommend taking less of PE then you
   would a typical shroom sold on the street, at least for your first
   time. It‚Äôs important to get a feel for them, before you go on an all
   out vision quest.

   People‚Äôs tolerances can vary widely. The following is recommendation
   based off of my own use, and discussions I‚Äôve had with my customers
   over the years.

   convenient/advantageous for the customer in several ways.† I will
   discuss my favorite ingestion methods, and some of the perks of
   grinding your mushrooms to powder.<span id="more-220"></span></p>
   <p>Powdered shroomies can be easier to ingest, with less gag reflex (if
   done correctly, more on that later in this article).† Being pleasant to
   ingest helps smooth you in to &#8220;the groove&#8221;, rather then
   grimacing over taste and texture of a dried version, of something many
   people already pick off of their dinner plate!</p>
   <blockquote><p><em><strong>This &#8220;Yuck&#8221; factor is often what
   creates a queasy feeling that can result in over reaction, and
   vomiting.</strong></em></p></blockquote> <p>It&#8217;s a belief that
   grinding shrooms to powder helps to increase the digestible
   &#8220;Surface Area&#8221;, essentially increasing the available
   particulate in your system, allowing for more of the
   &#8220;actives&#8221; to reach the bloodstream during digestion&#8230;
   and possibly resulting in a stronger trip.</p> <p>Mushrooms are known
   to be hard to digest when raw.† They are made of Chitin, a
   polysaccharide and essentially the same substance that insect and
   shellfish exoskeletons are constructed of.† If you wolf down large
   pieces of psychedelic mushroom, to avoid the taste and texture&#8230;
   you may not be getting your money&#8217;s worth.</p> <p>Grinding to
   powder helps with the digestion, it helps masquerade the taste and
   texture and allows you these three most popular ingestion methods
   (ordered by my preference).</p> <ol> <li>LemonTek</li>
   <li>Capsules</li> <li>Tea</li> </ol> <p><strong>LemonTek</strong> is my
   #1 recommendation.† Before I explain it&#8217;s preparation (which is
   very simple), let&#8217;s cover what it is &#8220;suppose&#8221; to be
   doing.</p> <p>It is believed that the acid in your lemon juice is
   pre-converting the psilocybin in to <span
   class="rendered_qtext">psilocin</span>.† This helps to expedite the on
   set of the trip, regardless of of whether the effects are illusion or
   not&#8230; there is a feeling of a <em>harder hitting rush</em> and
   increased potency.</p> <p>On top of this benefit is the incredible
   &#8220;masking&#8221; ability of the sour/tart in your lemon juice.† It
   quite easily masks the taste of your shrooms, and converts the dried
   powder in to a slurry which is much easier to swallow.</p>
   <p><em><strong>Preparation is easy and will take 25 minutes or
   less:</strong></em></p> <p>You will need a couple fresh lemons, or you
   could substitute with authentic fresh squeezed lemon juice such as the
   kind found in those plastic squeeze lemons (I believe there is also a
   bottled BBQ/Marinade version).† Limes will probably work equally as
   well.† Any citrus fruit <em>may</em> work, but I don&#8217;t have
   personal experience (a sour grapefruit comes to mind).</p> <p>A small
   glass (shot-glass is good) and 1 glass water/fruit juice as a
   chaser.</p> <p>Measure out the shroom dose you&#8217;re planning to
   take, and put that in your empty glass.† When adding liquid we want to
   create at first a paste, followed by a sludge and finally a slurry
   stirring between each.</p> <p><em>Squeezing your lemons before hand
   will be helpful.† It helps if your lemons or juice are at room
   temp.</em></p> <p>Slowly begin to add juice to the powder until it
   looks (just ever so barely) absorbed.† Give it a little stir.† Add a
   little more juice and it should become a liqduidy glob.† Give it another
   stir.† Finish up with as much juice as you desire (remember you&#8217;ll
   be drinking this!)</p> <p>At this point, if the sour/tart nature of
   lemons is unappealing to your buds, you could add a spoon full of honey
   or sugar (stir until dissolved).</p> <p>Let the concoction sit for
   10-20 minutes (not much longer).</p> <p>Knock back your creation (sip
   if you prefer), and wash down with the chaser you had on hand.</p>
   <blockquote><p>Please consume the remnants, any particles that remain
   in your glass will contain actives.† Disposing of them will be wasteful.†
   Swirl a little water in the glass to get the
   remainder.</p></blockquote> <p>Done! I do add a bit of sugar to my mix,
   and I find it pleasant enough.† It has a slightly <em>off</em> tasting
   lemon aid flavor, that doesn&#8217;t repulse me in the least.</p>
   <p>For me, LemonTek helps rush me through some of the
   &#8220;noise&#8221; and provides me a cleaner/clearer feeling.</p>
   <p><strong>Capsules (Gel Caps) </strong>area a trusty stand by for
   people with nausea problems.† They could still produce a gag reflex with
   people who find swallowing larger pills a difficulty.† Typically size 00
   and 000 gel caps are used for mushies (and they are pretty big).</p>
   <p>You can purchase a capsule making device at an affordable
   price&#8230; searching úcap-m-quikù on google will lead you to many
   sources.† You will want one that includes the TAMPER accessory.</p>
   <p>This isn&#8217;t a particularly convenient way to consume
   considering the effort involved in their creation.</p> <p>It may be
   necessary</p> <ul> <li>If you are reselling, most people will not want
   powder in a bag.</li> <li>For travel convenience (put them inside a
   vitamin container labeled as a herbal remedy).</li> <li>For smuggling
   in to events, they can be hidden easily, and not easily identified
   (they could be your diet aid/ lactose agent etc)</li> <li>The capsules
   offer a fairly decent air seal, and provide longevity outside of the
   original shipping container&#8230; this may be your best option to have
   your shrooms &#8220;out and about&#8221; with you.</li> </ul> <p>When
   consuming capsules, it&#8217;s important they are taken on an empty
   stomach.† Having a full belly is going to severely effect your trip.† ( I
   discuss this a bit further down).</p> <p><strong>Tea
   Preparation,</strong> I am not a big fan and do not recommend this to
   anyone who would like to &#8220;Trip Balls&#8221; (as it were).† This
   technique is most often used to feel the &#8220;mellow&#8221; highs of
   mushrooms.† It is definitely the most pleasant way to consume your
   shroomies, and I would be surprised to hear reports of any nausea.</p>
   <p>If gag reflex/nausea are preventing you from trying mushrooms, then
   Tea is the choice you should make.</p> <p><strong>It is a very straight
   forward process with a couple caveats.</strong></p> <p>You will need a
   small pot with lid, a fine strainer, a cup/mug and your favorite flavor
   teabag.</p> <p>Measure out your dose.† For the beginner I recommend
   750mg (this will be a very light trip).† For the experienced user, I
   suggest more then you would typically take as a whole mushroom&#8230;
   ie your dose +250mg (maybe +350mg).† This is with the assumption you
   will dispose of the mushroom grounds rather then eat them.</p> <p>Fill
   your cup/mug to the brim with water and add to the pot, put the lid on
   the pot and bring to boil.† Once at rapid boil remove from heat, add the
   mushrooms and stir until settled.† Add your teabag, place lid back on
   and steep for 5-10 minutes.</p> <p>Stir and pour through strainer, push
   out any extra liquid in your teabag &amp; mushroom grounds by pushing
   down on the teabag as it lays on the mushroom grounds inside the
   strainer.</p> <p>Add milk and sugar to your liking</p> <p>Done!† Tastes
   good.† Just to be certain, use a tea that&#8217;s not too delicate in
   flavor.</p> <p>Psilocybin/P<span class="rendered_qtext">silocin</span>
   are delicate crystals, we don&#8217;t want to boil the hell out of
   them!† We don&#8217;t want any excessive oxidization (if we can help it)
   and there usually is to a degree some loss of potency.</p> <p>You will
   not acquire all &#8220;actives&#8221; with this method, some will be
   left behind and disposed of.† Experimentation will be required to find
   your sweet spot.† You will likely need to use more product then if
   consumed by an alternative method such as LemonTek.</p>
   <p><strong>Other Methods </strong>I absolutely do not support methods
   like &#8220;peanut butter sandwich&#8221; and &#8220;Chocolate
   milkshake&#8221; etc.† It is <strong>very </strong>important that if you
   intend to reach the &#8220;Tripping Balls&#8221; levels, that you
   follow proper fasting and empty stomach protocol.</p> <p>Sure you could
   reach &#8220;tripping balls&#8221; by wolfing down 4grams after Sunday
   dinner, but why do that when 2 grams will do the same on an empty
   stomach?</p> <p><strong>Proper Fasting Protocols.</strong></p> <p>Any
   experienced Mushroom head will recommend the same. It is just fact that
   a clean digestive system, free of any recent meals and restricted
   liquid allowance&#8230; will produce a trip and experience far greater
   then one where the protocols are neglected.</p> <p>You should use 3+
   hours without food, as a very basic suggestion. 12+ hours would be a
   better place for people to start when doing spiritual work.† Lets not
   forget that our shaman forefathers often fasted for up to a week on
   water alone before their ritualistic use.</p> <p>If you wish to reach
   their plane(s) of existence, you will need to follow their rules.†
   Shamans offer themselves up as vessels to the spirit realm, to be
   possessed by and experienced through the use of a catalyst.</p> <p>It
   is a real thing, it is happening everywhere and always.</p> <p>Some
   people will not want these visitations.† Often when things get to moody,
   to dark and feel like they are getting out of hand&#8230; you may want
   to begin eating.</p> <blockquote><p>I have found in this circumstance
   that drinking milk helps bring me back to ease.† This is a reason why I
   do not suggest using Milk or Dairy products to begin your trip.† To me
   it seems counter intuitive, as much as tripping on a full
   stomach.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Other Protocols.</strong></p>
   <p>Equally as important to your physiological preparations, are your
   environmental and psychological preparations.</p> <p>Some people
   <em>looove</em> to &#8220;fear and loath&#8221; trip, any place any
   time&#8230; life is a party! The weirder the better, &#8220;where the
   freaks at?&#8221; .† If this does not appeal to you, then you should
   remove yourself from the company of these trippers.† They will be
   tripping Darkness.† I&#8217;ve been there myself.† It is exciting, but
   when it goes dark it can be overwhelming&#8230; approaching
   terrifying&#8230; So many flashbacks <img

   class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p> <p>If
   you find enlightenment more appealing, mushrooms can sing your song
   every time by removing these vexation before hand.† Be at a calm and
   meditative state hours previous to consuming your dose.† Do not burden
   your high mind with thoughts of &#8220;things you must do&#8221;. Take
   the rest of the day off specifically to trip.</p> <p>Ensure that you
   are in a place that no one can just &#8220;pop by&#8221; and interrupt
   your trip.† Make the people you must coexist with aware that you are on
   mushrooms and have begun to trip.† Full disclosure feels good if you can
   afford to&#8230;</p> <p>It is good to focus your train of thought on
   something positive.† If you are at home, surround yourself with trigger
   objects that reflect your happy memories.† If you are a music fan, I
   suggest something instrumental without too many lyrical layers&#8230;
   unless of course you wish a more intimate relationship with your
   favorite artists.</p> <p>Nothing feels better then a secure spot,
   outside on a warm summers evening.† Under the stars with the sounds of
   small animals scurrying, the wind wafting sweet smells of plant
   life&#8230; it&#8217;s almost as if we were born to a planet
   earth&#8230; and not to a diabolical economic war machine† hell bent on
   destruction and total control.</p> <p>I hope you find this writing
   helpful and informative!† Please feel free to ask your questions in the
   comments below&#8230; and by all means please enlighten us with your
   own recommendations&#8230; This is how we grow!</p>

   You&#8217;ll experience this for yourself. I do recommend taking less

   your first time. It&#8217;s important to get a feel for them, before

   Strong</em></strong>, I&#8217;m not just saying that because I sell
   them!† You&#8217;ll experience this for yourself. I do recommend taking
   less of PE then you would a typical shroom sold on the street, at least
   for your first time. It&#8217;s important to get a feel for them,
   before you go on an all out vision quest.</p> <p>People&#8217;s
   tolerances can vary widely. The following is recommendation based off
   of my own use, and discussions I&#8217;ve had with my customers over
   the years.</p> <p><strong>DOSAGE:</strong><span
   id="more-183"></span></p> <p><strong>.5</strong> <strong>Gram</strong>
   is a good euphoric dose, and is often the amount fitted inside a size
   00 Gel Capsule. This is a dose that lifts the mood&#8230; you can feel
   that you&#8217;ve taken something, but you could still easily go out,
   drink/dance and feel your spirits lifted. I don&#8217;t recommend going
   over this, and expecting to be fully functional in public.</p> <hr />
   <blockquote><p>The following doses are based on the expectation that
   you are following the protocols for good tripping as described in the
   &#8220;how to consume&#8221; guide. (my next project, I&#8217;ll post
   this soon).</p></blockquote> <hr /> <p><strong>1 Gram</strong> is where
   things become&#8230; mushroomy (is there really any other way to
   describe it? <img
   src="http://kpj3orlxmfs6yqah.onion/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-sm
   ile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height:
   1em;" /> ).† This is the dose I use to test my product. It gives you a
   run through the mushroom spectrum, without it completely overpowering
   your state of mind.</p> <p>It comes on in about 20-30 Minutes, reaching
   a peak at about an hour and half with a playful lingering that can last
   another 4-5 hours.</p> <p>My trips at 1G are usually pretty calm, I can
   go about my duties getting work done while listening to music.</p>
   <p>Colors become more vivid, tastes become tastier, music sounds
   splendid. Overall an enjoyable experience.</p> <p>I rarely feel any
   dark energy at 1G, you can expect yourself to function mostly
   normally.</p> <p>I wouldn&#8217;t try and do this dose at work and
   expect to get away with it&#8230; but a walk downtown, visit the art
   gallery, sunning at the beach, watching a movie&#8230; This is a good
   dose to liven up those activities, and possibly feel a profound insight
   from the experiences you are having.</p> <p>Scaling up from 1G should
   be tailored to your own chemistry, perhaps 1.5G is what you need to
   feel as I do on 1G.†† 2G opens up new doors/higher levels.</p> <hr />
   <p><strong>2 Grams</strong>, and you can begin to sense the presence of
   Divinity. It&#8217;s a mixed bag dose&#8230; I have often enough sailed
   through a 2 Gram dose without much in the way of new experience, but
   always a feeling of pleasure or profound importance.</p> <p>Time will
   begin to morph at this dose. <em>Gaps in time / spaciness</em> will
   emerge while you try and concentrate/focus . For a new user, this is
   where things could become dark.</p> <p>When you hear the phrase
   &#8220;let yourself go&#8221;, this is the mind space being talked
   about. It is better to learn to work with this energy, then it is to
   fight against it.† Inflicting your will on the trip, can make things go
   sideways.† Be with the trip not against it.</p> <p>Keep yourself calm,
   if you need to rationalize, remember that you have only just consumed
   the safest psychedelic on the planet, and the trip will eventually
   end.</p> <p>Nervous energies can form, while you &#8220;experience
   yourself experiencing mushrooms&#8221; (maybe for the first time) This
   is often where people may react badly to their shrooms.† Sensing this
   shift in consciousness&#8230; they feel overpowered.</p>
   <blockquote><p>An animalistic impulse is to purge the contents of the
   stomach in the hopes to feel better. If need be, provide yourself that
   relief&#8230; but remember your crazy shamanistic ancestry and how this
   would be frowned on! Be brave <img

   class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"
   /></p></blockquote> <p><em>After some experience, a 2 Gram dose will
   likely become your &#8220;go to&#8221; dose.</em></p> <p>2G almost
   always for me starts out <strong>CHAOTIC</strong>, I sense myself
   sending and receiving information through dimensional portals. I can
   close my eyes, and meditate on colors that come to life, and exhibit a
   will of their own. When you work through your dark energy you will
   begin to approach something I can only call
   <strong>&#8220;Glow&#8221;</strong>.</p> <p>Glow for me, is an
   overwhelming sense of well being.† It&#8217;s like poetry in motion,
   it&#8217;s the spark of creativity&#8230; it is the first feelings of
   understanding.† It is when the world begins to intuitively make sense,
   without the need for words and with perfect realization&#8230;
   I&#8217;m always looking for Glow! =) it is a treat for the brave!</p>
   <p>That being said, often glow comes only to those willing for the
   &#8220;Heroic Dose&#8221; as Terance Mckenna would phrase it. (an
   excellent man that you should all know!)</p> <hr /> <p><strong>3.5
   Grams</strong> (a Heroic Dose) Is a popular dose in the Mushroom world.
   It&#8217;s been a standby dose you can recommend to anyone, knowing
   that&#8230; ok it might be a bit much for them, but we all know
   they&#8217;ll survive (provided they don&#8217;t lose their mind to
   fear, or maybe injure themselves from a lack of fear.† No jumping off of
   roofs believing you can fly please!).</p> <blockquote><p>3.5G is
   <strong>more then safe</strong> chemically speaking, but this begins a
   dose size that could have you &#8220;lose yourself&#8221; for a
   spell.</p></blockquote> <p>People who recommend you do mushrooms, want
   you to understand the &#8220;depth&#8221; of the experience. The
   previous doses recommended, may not provide that depth. This is why so
   many will recommend 3.5G, so that you <em>&#8220;get there&#8221;</em>
   and know it for what it is.</p> <p>Ego Deaths have and will continue
   for some at this level. Personally I have not had Ego Death at 3.5G,
   but I know many that have. I have a few tails told of Stomach Pumps at
   the hospital at 3.5G. This is why I recommend you know PE, don&#8217;t
   be to big and mighty!</p> <blockquote><p>Mushrooms have never really
   been a &#8220;party drug&#8221; and they should never be considered
   that at this high a dose.</p></blockquote> <p>3.5G and above, you
   really should be meditating in a tranquil spot, with no expectations to
   be any good to anyone, and if you&#8217;re inexperienced you should be
   with someone (who is not on anything), watching over you.</p>
   <p><strong>There will be Chaos</strong>! There will be alien artifacts
   &amp; visitation through unseen portals! you will not have a choice in
   the matter.</p> <p><strong>Mushrooms will own you for the next 4-8
   hours</strong>. You will be subject to what the mushrooms want to show
   you, not what you want to show mushrooms.† Absolutely do not attempt to
   drive or do anything that puts others in danger!</p> <p>This dose will
   drag you through the dirt, until you learn to behave! If you are trying
   to stand up raging, howling mad cursing your enemies! You will have a
   bad time man! sit back down.</p> <p>3.5G is going to learn you, (real
   quick) that the only way to enlightenment is through peaceful
   cohabitation with the other energies.</p> <p>The Chaos of Life/Death,
   Up/Down, Left/Right, On/Off right/wrong yin/yang&#8230; decisions, the
   perception of time will spin faster and faster and faster until it
   finally shatters in to a <strong>sweet unconscious release of
   divinity</strong>.</p> <blockquote><p>This is ego death&#8230; and this
   is subject to personal interpretation&#8230; and this is why we
   invented conversation. (both consciously and
   subconsciously)</p></blockquote> <p>It can be scary first time, and the
   more you learn to let go, the sweeter the final reward&#8230; after you
   climb the mountain, there is the kindest most loving glow imaginable
   that walks you down the path and back to earth.† Do not take your earth
   mother for granted!</p> <p>It has never betrayed me! On my
   roughest/wildest adventures, it has always carried me home. These truly
   are spirit molecules, and the language of Gods!</p> <hr /> <p><strong>5
   Grams</strong> is my Ego Death dose. It can go one of two ways for me
   at this dose, &#8220;really good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221;. (but not
   so much really bad anymore, I&#8217;ve learned to talk myself down)</p>
   <p>If good, it&#8217;s an indescribable feeling of wave after wave
   breaking against the shoreline of self. You can feel suddenly lifted
   from body, and transported to the astral realms. I often detect myself
   communicating with loved ones I&#8217;ve lost, picturesque settings
   will form from light acting as if molecules re arranged for my own
   experience.† You feel compelled to <strong>BEHOLD!</strong></p>
   <p><em>If it goes bad</em>, if I were to Video Record myself at this
   dose, you would see a wild monstrosity, squirming and writhing on the
   floor (on the floor because there&#8217;s no way I could stand or even
   sit up)</p> <p>I&#8217;m usually on my knees begging for forgiveness
   for what I&#8217;ve just begun.† I feel The Mighty Hammer of judgment
   striking my skull until it finally cracks, and I ooze on to the
   carpet&#8230; and the ooze is good <img
   src="http://kpj3orlxmfs6yqah.onion/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-sm
   ile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height:
   1em;" />† Unfortunately this can take hours, that feel like an
   eternity.</p> <p>It is an oooh so uncomfortable feeling &#8220;for
   me&#8221; this high, to go bad&#8230; but the absolutely mind boggling
   nature of all things existing at once becomes so clear.† There is
   knowledge and character strengthening even in the worst of trips.† What
   doesn&#8217;t kill you makes your stronger (or insane) <img
   src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="õ"
   class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
   <blockquote><p><strong>ME on a bad trip</strong></p> <p>I have to go
   back now, I have to go back now! please let me down, please let me
   down, yes YES!† here it is, here is my body, finally rest&#8230; finally
   I can rest. There&#8217;s my embarrassing truth, I&#8217;ll take it!
   it&#8217;s mine to love, it is the truth of me.</p></blockquote> <p>In
   my bad trips, I can feel a kind of &#8220;trickery&#8221; taking place.†
   I feel attempts being made by less then friendly entities trying to
   coerce my subconscious into believing lies&#8230; it&#8217;s still
   uncertain to me their function in nature.</p> <p>If you seek balance,
   you will receive balance.† If you seek good you will find good.† If you
   seek evil, you will find evil. positivity for positivity / negativity
   for negativity.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t do doses this high any more, they
   were a novelty at first, but now I am content to reach glow&#8230;
   without the shattering voice of god echoing truth in my mind!</p>
   <p>Anything above this level, I wish you the best! be safe, and you
   really should know what you are doing!</p> <hr /> <p>I&#8217;d love to
   hear your own personal dose recommendations based on your use and
   personal experience. Please feel free to enlighten us in the comment
   section!† If you have a Trip report please share in the forum!</p>

MUSHBUD ‚Äì Stealth


   I have 2 forms of stealth.  One specifically for (10)G the other for
   (30)G and larger.
     __________________________________________________________________

   About the (10)G Stealth:

   The stealth is ULTRA SNEAKY.  It is disguised to look like any other
   mailing sent out a million times a day. The package does not shift
   weight when moved, does not produce strange sounds or smells. There
   will be -no- scent‚Ä¶ the contents will be bagged (Mylar laminate) &
   vacuum sealed! The package is plain and inconspicuous, no identifying
   marks or strange shapes. It is very small/thin and will fit in to any
   mailbox.

   Should the package be opened, it has been labeled and presented in a
   way to (hopefully) deceive a customs agent in to believing that it is
   something legal. So far it has done a very good job at that!
     __________________________________________________________________

   About the (30)G + Stealth:

   (30)G stealth is my best stealth. The package is naturally larger then
   (10)G as it contains 3x the content.  The extra size has allowed me to
   elaborate on the presentation.

   It now looks completely professional, exactly as you would expect a
   product to look as if it was purchased legally from a reputable online
   business.  Customs would need to send your package to a laboratory to
   know for certain that it was illegal.

   I have crafted this packaging technique, with extra attention to
   detail.  My goal was to produce a reliable stealth capable of passing
   Australia‚Äôs notoriously strict visual inspection.  So far it has been
   doing an excellent job!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Both stealth techniques will be professionally labeled, including a
   Return Address. This return address is FAKE, so be sure to double check
   your mailing address is correct in the PGP message you provide. This is
   your responsibility.  If the pack is returned to sender, there will be
   no getting it back!

     Do NOT try to contact me at the fake return address or the fake
     information included with the package!

   Not having a name on the package will raise suspicion, you must provide
   a name with your address. This name should be associated with the
   address!  Fake names on PO Boxes are more often then not returned to
   sender!  This seems to be a postal policy in many countries.

   My packs do not and will never require a signature. They will be
   delivered to your mailbox/slot with your bills & junk mail. Be sure not
   to throw it out by accident!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Precaution!

   Regardless of the quality of the stealth, suspicions can be raised at
   YOUR boarder when the arrival frequency is high.  If you are ordering
   too many packages too soon, eventually someone with authority will
   confiscate your packages, to err on the side of caution even if they
   can‚Äôt prove it illegal.

   I ship multiple package orders 24 hours apart to stagger arrival days.
   Even so, Several packages arriving from Canada in a short period of
   time will no doubt peak the attention of some Government official in
   your Country.  Use your discretion, and purchase only what you need‚Ä¶
   wait to purchase additional packages when they are needed.

MUSHBUD ‚Äì Policy


   I offer 2 products essentially.  My original (10)G Stealth, and my
   newer (30)G+ Stealth. (30)G+ Stealth has no guarantee of safe arrival,
   however the (10)G does to an extent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I will no longer guarantee more then 1 open Transaction of a quantity
   of (1) 10G Pack.  ‚ÄúTransaction‚Äù = The entire process, from your order
   to -in your hands- delivery.

   IE: The ideal Transaction would be that: the customer orders 1 (10)G,
   and then waits for that order to arrive, and then if they wish, they
   order another.

   This would make your ‚Äúopen‚Äù transaction a Finished or Closed
   transaction.  I will continue to guarantee those (10)G transactions
   100%

   If you are impatient and decide to order a pack every 24 hours: Then
   you have created several ‚ÄúOpen Transactions‚Äù of which I will only
   guarantee (1).

   If you order multiple (10)G packs all at once, and they are all seized‚Ä¶
   i will only guarantee 1 of those packs.

   If your packs are seized from the suspicion generated due to the extra
   traffic you‚Äôve created for your address, why would you expect me to be
   liable for your action?

   I refuse to be, so use your discretion and accept this risk on to
   yourself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   (30)G+ has been from it‚Äôs time of introduction a ‚Äúbuy at your own risk‚Äù
   purchase.

   In my previous markets (mainly SR2 & Agora) I would have the customer
   send me a confirmation PM that would have him/her indicate that they
   understood the risk was their own.  I now have a check box for terms on
   the order page.

   I have put my very best effort in to the (30)G+ stealth, it is very
   effective and so far has nearly 100% success.

   I can‚Äôt honestly say full 100%, to clarify the situation.  I have had 1
   customer who did not receive their pack after they had several packs a
   week sent to the same address in Africa over the course of 5 weeks.

   The frequency of identical shipments arriving to the same address over
   weeks will no doubt raise suspicions at your post office, especially if
   it‚Äôs a post office that does not ordinarily receive mail from Canada
   (or the western world).

   I caution people not to do this, please order what you need. 1 per week
   is acceptable for larger/populated Westernized Countries.

   I will not limit you as this is a customer‚Äôs ‚Äúacceptable risk‚Äù
   decision‚Ä¶  but understand this is one of the reasons why I will not
   guarantee these larger sizes.
