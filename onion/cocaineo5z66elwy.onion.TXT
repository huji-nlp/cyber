   The following are Acetone and Chloroform Cocaine Washing Procedures
   that I have found from various places on the internet:

   Okay, please note that I'll be using 3 grams of adulterated cocaine as
   my example for this procedure, so keep that in mind. You should use 15
   ml.s of acetone per every 1 gram of cocaine.

   Crush up your 3 grams of adulterated cocaine as fine as possible. I
   have personally found that using a fine screened juice strainer best
   for getting finely ground powder.

   Pour your crushed up cocaine into 45-50 ml.s of acetone. Put the cap
   back onto your acetone bottle immediately to avoid any moisture from
   the air getting in. Stir the cocaine in the acetone for approx. 3-5
   minutes making sure to get around the bottom edges etc. Cover with a
   small piece of paper or something to keep any moisture out and let
   settle until the cleaned cocaine crystals are on the bottom and your
   acetone at the top has become completely clear or dirty looking, but
   free of any crystals floating in it. This should take anywhere from 3
   to 10 minutes.

   Now, carefully pour your dirty acetone into a filter placed inside of
   your plastic funnel and resting atop your drinking glass. It is
   important on this first run to stop as short of any cocaine falling out
   into the filter as possible (it's okay if some crystals fall into the
   filter paper, leave them there). This will provide us with the
   opportunity to perform a second wash on the crystals in the beaker.
   Now, with some crystals stuck to the side of the beaker from pouring
   and most at the bottom, pour 30 more ml.s of fresh acetone into the
   beaker trying to collect those crystals stuck on the side while pouring
   in. Stir again and cover. This time, pour your entire contents into the
   filter paper. If some crystals are left clinging to the beaker, pour a
   lil' fresh acetone in, swirl and pour them in as well. With your clean
   crystals inside the filter paper, cover. Once all, or most of the
   acetone has drained thru into the drinking glass, pour 20 more ml.s of
   fresh acetone into the filter paper. This will provide us with the
   third and last cleansing. Cover and let drain completely. This could
   take 5-10 minutes at the most.

   Once all of the acetone has drained thru, carefully remove the filter
   paper containing the newly cleaned and now beautiful crystals and place
   it between three or four paper towels. Fold the towels over the filter
   paper and press firmly on the cocaine to absorb any additional acetone.
   Discard paper towels and place the somewhat dried filter paper still
   containing the crystyals under a heat lamp for approx. 20 minutes.
   Remove from under heat lamp.

   Now, this last step is very important. For your own health and for the
   true taste, feel and aesthetics of the newly cleaned cocaine, you must
   let it evaporate on it's own, still inside of the filter paper for at
   least 24 hours in a non-humid environment. At the 24+ mark, gently heat
   the crystals, while still inside of the filter paper, for approx. 10
   minutes or so. Remove from heat.

   Carefully open the filter paper and let the clump of beautiful cocaine
   fall out onto an awaiting ceramic plate. Rub the filter paper together
   over the plate if any is stuck to it. Carefully open up the clump to
   examine your newly formed, clean and pure crystals. This will resemble
   nothing of which you started with, no matter how good or bad it looked.

   Crush up finely into a couple of lines and snort away. "HOLY SHIT,
   there's no burn, no smell, but wait a minute, I'm starting to feel a
   warm rush throughout my entire body!" "I'm feeling an extreme euphoria
   coming over me". "The back of my throat is numb as hell". "I feel
   fucking great"! "No edgyness, ampyness or uncomfortableness. I've never
   felt this good before". Or any other quotes something of the like all
   thru the night anyway................=D

   AGREED WASHING PROCEDURE

   The following double wash procedure has been devised by the community
   for removing the majority of common adulterants. Adulterants in cocaine
   do change over time but as of writing this procedure results in a very
   good end product with vastly reduced levels of levamisole and
   manufacturing by-products. Thanks go to everyone that has contributed
   to this thread but especially Chemhead, 2Fruits and AceOfClubs:

   WASH 1

   1 - Procure the basic chemicals required for the wash. These are pure
   acetone, pure TCM (chloroform) and anhydrous calcium chloride.

   2 - Dry the two solvents separately with anhydrous calcium chloride.
   This is done by adding a few grams of finely crushed calcium chloride
   to the acetone and chloroform and leaving them at least 24 hours in an
   airtight glass beaker

   3 - The TCM should be left in the freezer for 24 hours to reduce it to
   -15C - -20C

   4 - Chop the cocaine as finely as possible - A fine-mesh snuff grinder
   can be used for this if available or a glass mortar and pestle can be
   fashioned using two flat glass surfaces

   5 - Place your 'dirty' cocaine in a small glass beaker. A shot glass
   can be used but an airtight lid will help reduce fumes and also reduce
   exposure to moisture. A small 30-50ml reagent bottle with stopper is
   perfect

   6 - Add 15ml of acetone to the cocaine, stir, cover and leave for 5
   minutes

   7 - Pour off the acetone through a filter paper leaving as much of the
   cocaine in the beaker as possible. The liquid that has passed through
   the filter is discarded. The particles trapped in the filter are
   retained.

   8 - Add another 10-15ml of acetone to the beaker, stir and pour through
   the filter paper catching all of the cocaine in the filter

   9 - Use more acetone to wash any remaining cocaine from the beaker
   through the filter

   10 - Discard the dirty acetone and let the cocaine dry for 24 hours
   until there is no acetone smell - Chopping up the resulting powder at
   this stage can help with evaporation

   WASH 2

   11 - Add your acetone washed cocaine to another clean beaker or shot
   glass

   12 - Add 25ml of iced chloroform to the beaker and cover

   13 - Swirl for 5 minutes. The cocaine will dissolve in the chloroform.
   Anything remaining undissolved is not cocaine

   14 - Pour all of the liquid through a clean filter paper that has been
   pre-wet with chloroform

   15 - Catch the liquid passing through the filter in a clean evaporation
   tray. A large flat glass dish is perfect. This liquid contains the
   cocaine - it is therefore crucially important not to spill any

   16 - Discard the filter paper and anything trapped in it - this is
   levamisole or other cuts

   17 - Leave the glass dish containing the chloroform to evaporate
   somewhere dark and well ventilated

   18 - The resulting powder / crystals can be scraped off the evaporation
   dish with a blade. This is very pure cocaine

   19 - The crystals should be scrapped up and finely chopped and left for
   another 24 hours to fully evaporate

   20 - Enjoy - the coke should have no taste / smell of acetone or TCM.
   If it does you must let it dry further as these chemicals should not be
   consumed

   EQUIPMENT

   The majority of this double wash can be performed with household
   equipment but it is important to use glass equipment as the solvents
   will dissolve many plastics. A basic list of equipment includes the
   following (with household substitutions):

   500ml / 1000ml Reagent bottles to store solvents - Amber glass
   preferred - Can substitute cleaned wine bottles with PTFE stopper (mark
   them carefully to avoid confusion)

   Small 50ml reagent bottles for washes - Stopper or cap preferred - Can
   substitute shot glasses with a saucer used to cover the glass during
   washes

   Glass pipette for measuring out solvents - It is possible to pour
   solvents but there is much more margin for error

   Glass Evaporation Dish - Any large completely flat dish can be used for
   evaporation. A pyrex baking tray can be used if cleaned correctly
   before use

   Filter Papers - 15cm Medium flow papers are preferred - Can substitute
   standard coffee filters

   Just remember cocaine dissolves in very small amounts of water so
   Acetone must be Dryed to make it Anhydrous...

   To dry acetone place Epsom salts in thin layer on aluminum foil..place
   in 400 Degree F oven for 2 hours...turn off oven and let cool down..do
   not open door for 2 hours...put chunks of baked Epsom salts in mason
   jar about 1/4 full...add acetone to very top leaving no air...put
   aluminum foil over top(Rubber seal on lid will disintegrate without
   foil)...screw down lid tight...place in ziplock bag...close bag shake
   well and place in freezer for at least 24 hours...when needed take jar
   out of freezer careful not to shake contents...siphon off of top what
   you need quickly, and reseal and put jar back in freezer.

   Put 1 gram cocaine in shot glass...crush as much as possible...add 15ml
   Dry Acetone...swirl around for a minute...put playing card and weight
   on top of shot glass and let sit till particles settle...about a
   minute.. siphon off acetone only...repeat with 10ml, and repeat again
   with 5ml...Vacum filter remaining cocaine or pour into cone type coffee
   filter...use a little fresh dry acetone to wash out shot-glass and pour
   into filter then a little more fresh dry acetone over cocaine in
   filter...press filter between fingers to get out last drops of
   acetone...use hair dryer on low blowing thru filter to dry
   further...lay out on plate and chop as finely as you can...let sit for
   a day...crush into fine powder and let sit for at least one more day
   although 3-4 more days is best to evaporate all acetone and let cocaine
   cure...have patience, or keep some unwashed to do while your waiting,
   but you want to wait at least minimum of two days after wash before
   snorting, and waiting 4-5 will dramatically improve taste and
   absorption of final product...and there you have it...best of luck!!

   Remember Acetone wash will remove most inactive cuts...but will not
   remove Leva=Poison...for that you need to then do an ice cold
   Chloroform wash. And neither Acetone or Chloroform will remove
   Ephedrine or Amphetamines, or Methamphetamine. To get rid of those you
   have to take the washed coke...Freebase it...then do a 2ml cold water
   wash per gram of Freebase...then convert it back to Cocaine HCL for
   snorting or IV'ing.

   PhenacetinAni1500x223

   Though phenacetin might not be quite as dangerous (debatable) a
   substance as levamisole is, it seems to be even more prevalent in
   cocaine than levamisole is. Phenacetin was used as a pain-relieving and
   fever-reducing drug in the USA for nearly 100 years before being banned
   by the FDA in 1983. Its use in the medical profession now in the US is
   very limited, but it is still be used in some other countries.

   In humans, many case reports have implicated products containing
   phenacetin in urothelial neoplasms, especially urothelial carcinoma of
   the renal pelvis. In one prospective series, phenacetin was associated
   with an increased risk of death due to urologic or renal diseases,
   death due to cancers, and death due to cardiovascular diseases.

   Chronic use of phenacetin is known to lead to analgesic nephropathy
   characterized by renal papillary necrosis. This is a condition which
   results in destruction of some or all of the renal papillae in the
   kidneys!

   One notable death that can possibly be attributed to the use of this
   drug was that of the aviation pioneer Howard Hughes. He had been using
   phenacetin extensively for the treatment of chronic pain; it was stated
   during his autopsy that phenacetin use may have been the cause of his
   kidney failure.

   Since phenacetin is being used as a cutting agent AFTER the cocaine has
   arrived from its South American home, many samples of cocaine now are
   being found to have both phenacetin and levamisole in them! Often times
   this substance is also called “Super Buff” because of its physical and
   refractive properties of crystals.

   It seems that phenacetin is more often found in cocaine in the UK and
   Canada than other nations.

   This is the link to the Wiki on phenacetin:

   [4]TorontoRaid250x166

   The image above is from a Toronto Drug Squad raid in which they seized
   25 kilos of cocaine and 24 kilo of phenacetin! Though we will never
   know for sure what the ration of phenacetin to cocaine they were
   planning to use, it is very troubling over the fact they had nearly the
   same amounts of each. To learn more about this go to

   AS MUCH as 60% of the cocaine seized in Britain has been found to have
   traces of a once-banned, cancer-causing painkiller.

   Taken from a news article from the Scotsman:

   Phenacetin does not have any other use than a painkiller and is mainly
   produced in Spain. It was initially banned in the late 1960s, but
   production resumed some years later under strict guidelines.

   Phenacetin can be legally imported into the UK and does not require
   licensing unless the buyer intends to alter its chemical make-up.

   A recent report on phenacetin in an American medical magazine stated
   "chronic users of analgesic drugs containing phenacetin are at
   increased risk of developing hypertension and of dying from cancer or
   diseases of the kidneys, heart or circulatory system.

   "This follows a 20-year study of 623 then healthy women aged 30 to 49
   who regularly took phenacetin for chronic aches and pains."

   It continued: "According to the study, the women who took
   phenacetin-containing painkillers doubled their chances of dying.

   "They were l6 times more likely to have a kidney disease or one in the
   urinary tract, almost twice as likely to die of cancer, and almost
   three times as likely to die of heart disease whilst the risk of
   developing cardiovascular disease was nearly two to one."

   Purity and adulterant analysis of crack seizures in Brazil. Research
   from the Forensic Science International:

   Drug purity and composition varies according to the region,
   availability and their presentation. Previous French reports analyzed
   373 samples of cocaine salts obtained in 2006. Median purity was 23%
   and average purity was 29%. The most frequent adulterants were
   phenacetin (54%), caffeine (17%), paracetamol (14%), diltiazem (11%),
   lidocaine (11%), and levamizol (6%).

   Phenacetin Nephropathy, with Particular Reference to the Effect of
   Surgery

   Sixteen patients suffering from phenacetin nephropathy were seen at one
   London hospital between June 1964 and January 1970. There were five
   deaths, three of them following a surgical operation. Phenacetin
   nephropathy occurs far more frequently than is generally considered.
   Unless patients are asked about the consumption of phenacetin routinely
   the diagnosis is usually missed.

   JetSetLife - Panama Batch of Cocaine August 2016

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC.


   This review is on the batch of cola that he is selling as the “Panama”
   batch on the Dream Marketplace.
   [2]http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/viewProduct?offer=476877.440886

   I have “talked” with JSL about this product and it is from a different
   source than his usual and it comes packaged differently than most too.
   The name “Panama” has nothing to do with where the coca was grown or
   even processed, so please do not assume that this cola was grown there.

   Package arrived in what I would consider to be a safe manner, but there
   was no decoy being used.

   As usual with anything that I have received from JSL, it was point on
   in weight. When opened it has a nice clean, almost organic smell to it.
   Just the smell alone is enough to convince the knowledgeable cocaine
   user that this should be a good batch.

   It beautifully passes the “between the fingers” test. It stays its
   white self for a moment and then starts breaking down to a nice, clear
   oil with no grit or residue left behind. A little bit subjected to a
   couple drops of water and it all disappears and the smell is clean. I
   could not pick up a scent of petroleum! When I put that in my mouth,
   there was the natural cocaine bitterness, that alkaloid bite that we
   all know and love, but no nastiness of a petrol base or a bad cut. The
   alkaloid bite was maybe a little stronger than the norm.

   I have a feeling that for the smokers, this shit is the bomb as when I
   did the ammonia test, it just about all seemed to come back.

   [3]JSLBanner7fs01400x1 So next the real test and that is a small line.
   Do not make the mistake that I made with this batch! This stuff is
   strong! Just tiny bumps are all you and anyone that I had sample this
   needed to be satisfied. In my opinion this is some type of a Colombian
   strain. But it is processed differently maybe than we are usually
   seeing coming from Colombia theese days.

   Though it seems that this batch mostly comes in a mix of all very small
   pieces, when you look closely at this stuff under a bright light, it is
   all pearlescence flakes. It is not grit or dust, but very tiny flakes
   that if you shave down with a razor blade just keep slicing into
   smaller and smaller pearlescence flakes. It is pretty. The “bigger” of
   the small chunks give some resistance, but not a brittleness, when
   shaved with a razor blade. Hot plating would be recommended.

   So this stuff has a bit of a “edge” to it. For an old timer like
   myself, I need to keep this in check and be sure just to do a little at
   a time. I never got the teeth grinding action or anything like that,
   but this is certainly a “GET OUT AND PARTY” batch and not the let’s get
   that office work done type buzz of the more mellower Peruvian type of
   cocaine. My friends became very talkative on this.

   I am too old to be using it anyway but snorting, but my bet is this is
   the type of stuff the more hardcore users would enjoy quite a bit. It
   certain broke down to what looked to be very clean.

   This batch has been sent off to Energy Control for testing and once I
   get the results back, I will be posting it for all to see and examine.
   So far JSL has never sent anything to me that has been questionable, or
   something that I won’t do until I get the results back. It is nice to
   know there is a consistent cola vendor here.

   Plus the price is right on this batch! It is tough to go wrong on this
   one. I believe an 8ball of this is $227.00.

   Well by the time the Energy Control tests results came back in, the
   product was sold out. Here are the links to the PDF results which was
   75% cocaine, 4% levamisole and 2% caffeine:

   PartySupply July Review 2016

   Fair, honest, objective cocaine reviews by OC.


   This is the type of a review usually a reviewer does not want to make,
   but it is my job to be as honest as I can about the product samples I
   receive. Also I want to apologize to PartySupply and everyone else that
   this review is about four days late, but some things came up IRL and
   that had to be taken care of.

   This is what PartySupply is calling their Peruvian batch. They are on
   the Dream Market.

   PARTYSUPPLY HAS MADE ME AWARE THAT THIS BATCH HAS NOT BEEN SOLD AND IT
   WAS SENT TO ME FOR TESTING AND IT IS DOUBTFUL HE WILL BE SELLING THIS
   BATCH!

   I received the sample package from PartySupply right on time and it was
   pretty clever shipping, but it could use some improvements and I told
   PS about this and he responded positively, so I think this will be
   corrected. It came well sealed. It was point on weight.

   When it arrived I was with a friend and so I was not able to get to do
   some of my usual first steps that I do when I first open a new batch of
   cola. But we did do a couple lines together and we experienced a mild,
   pleasant buzz after a few minutes. But the taste was pretty off to me
   and her too.

   We talked for a long while as this seems to be a “chatty” type of
   product and I gave her some to take home and evaluate. I did a total of
   four lines that evening and was getting very tired, so I went to bed
   and it took forever to fall asleep. Usually I sleep very well after
   some top tier cola. When I spoke to my friend the next day, she said
   the same thing about not being able to sleep for hours.

   This sample did not “fluff out” when chopped with a razor blade and
   would just get to a finer powder and grit. There was not a bite or
   sting to it and it was fairly smooth going up.

   I was not able to get back to the product again for a couple days. I
   then did the “between the fingers” test and this batch did not pass
   that test! There was very little oiliness and there was a lot of grit
   and powder left behind. Then it did not pass the water test (images
   included), nor did it pass the ammonia test. (lost the images!).

   The water test as you see, was quite simple, just some of the
   PartySupply’s batch in a spoon and then just a few drops of cold water.
   The first image is with the water on the cola for about five seconds
   and the second image is about after 12 seconds after the water was
   added. The last image was after the sample was stirred in the water.
   This is just too much residue!

   The ammonia test was putting about twice as much of the sample in a
   spoon with about twice as much ammonia than the water test. It left
   about the same amount of residue content percentage as the water.

   My personal evaluation tells me this has been re-bricked at least once
   since it left South America. The average street cocaine buyer might not
   have a problem with this and might actually like it. But this is not a
   Top Tier type of a product like I have been used to for the last year
   or so.

   Communication has been good with PartySupply and I sort of really doubt
   that he has added any adulterant/s his/herself. It is a shame to have
   to pan a new vendor’s product and I hate doing that. But I can not
   advice anyone that considers themselves to be a connoisseur of the cola
   to jump on this batch.

   PartySupplyJuly1620453x269 PartySupplyJuly1624453x259

   PartySupplyJuly1626453x244

   PartySupplyJuly1630453x205

   This is what the batch of PartySupply’s Peruvian looks like, about 1.5
   grams.

   PartySupplyJuly1644453x244 PartySupplyJuly1645453x364

   This was the sample before any water was added.

   PartySupplyJuly1646453x327 PartySupplyJuly1647453x230

   The first image with water was taken about 5 seconds after the water
   was added and the second image was taken about 12 seconds afterward.

   PartySupplyJuly1649453x397


   This last image was taken after the sample was stirred some and there
   was still quite a bit of residue left behind.









   So do not worry about PartySupply! He wants to be sure his product is
   safe before selling on the DN and so this batch is NOT available on his
   stores!

   The Energy Control test results for the batch that I tested is not good
   at all.

   Sample Code: sp629
   Substance: cocaine
   Lab Code: 99502
   Result: Caffeine 21% + Levamisole 3% + Cocaine 10% + Tetracaine 3%

   GreatWhite Shark - 1st week of November 2016

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC.

   This is the long awaited review for the newest batch of cocaine from
   the vendor known as GreatWhiteShark. I apologize for this review coming
   out a couple days later than it should, but when dealing with the
   DarkNet, sometimes you got to pull back to deal with real life
   situations first. Fortunately though real life did not interfere with
   mailing out a sample of this very nice example of yayo the very next
   business day after receiving this. So it should be arriving at Energy
   Control within a few days, if all goes well.

   First I shall mention the packaging and stealth. Big fat YES! We each
   have our own situation as far as drops go, but for my drop situation,
   this pack came in perfect, including some very festive stealth. The
   pack came Priority Mail and it blends in well with all the other mail I
   receive.

   The weight was right on point. The product was chunky, not in one or
   two pieces. The color is slightly off-white and the texture was nearly
   like the cola that I just last reviewed from a Euro vendor. It is hard,
   dry and brittle. Care needs to be taken when using a razor blade. As I
   said previously, when I get this type of texture it makes me a little
   more wary of what it might be.

   A finger tip test reveals the finely chopped substance first quickly
   turning into a white paste and then disappears in a clear, shiny oil
   with no residue left behind. Exactly what you want to see. Rubbed my
   fingers onto my gums and waited a few seconds for a mild numb to come
   about. Nothing to indicate any added “caines”.

   When I put that spoonful of cocaine water into my mouth, my reaction
   was immediate and I said sort of loudly, “Ewww!” It was sharply bitter,
   more so than what I am used to.

   After waiting a few minutes I next put some of the finely chopped coke
   into a spoon and dripped three drops on and around it. Almost all of it
   dissipated into clearness and when I wiggled the spoon the rest of it
   was basically gone. When I brought the spoon up close to a desk light
   and looked closely, I could see just the smallest trace of something,
   but this was scarcely noticeable. So it passed the water test nicely.
   The odor was very light and slightly chemical, no noticeable petroleum
   smell.

   Just a note here: It seems things are really starting to change here as
   far as the processing of cocaine. I am getting less and less of the
   stuff that reeks of petrol and that is a very good thing.

   It takes a little work and carefulness to get this apart with a razor
   blade and it not flying away. I basically am using a razor blade for
   all my reviews so that I can be consistent, but this would be the type
   of stuff a grinder or sifter would come in handy.

   Now time for a little inhalation of the substance. (You might note that
   many reviewers will say “insufflation” but that is not the proper use
   of the word.) As with any new batch of illicit drug you are trying for
   the first time, start off small and then adjust accordingly, so one
   medium sized line and it went up very nicely. It was smooth and light.
   Moments later it seemed to clear up my sinuses on that side. In less
   than ten minute later that pleasant feeling of niceness or euphoria was
   starting to hit.

   item2


   Later after the second same sized snort my nostril “watered” just
   slightly, but the sinuses remained clear.

   The “high” of this batch of coke is quite clean and pleasant, I never
   got the “jitters” or any speedy affect. It remained very smooth, but
   then again I was going doing small doses properly spaced out for what I
   was doing. My lady friend thought it was quite delightful.

   After my first fun night with this batch I had the best sleep in a few
   weeks.

   I got to test this batch a few different nights, each with a nice,
   clean euphoria and no after affects the days later. While working away
   at the computer I would find myself just working away and not even
   thinking about doing more and it was surprising how little I was dosing
   and having a good night getting shit done.

   If GWS can keep getting this type of quality, he will do very well here
   on the DN.

   Once I receive the Energy Control test results for this batch, I will
   update this review for everyone.

   UPDATE December 27, 2016: I just received the results of this batch of
   cocaine from GreatWhiteShark and it has a very disappointing percentage
   with it:

   Sample code: QQ123 / QQ321
   Substance: cocaine
   Lab code: 101587
   Result: Levamisole 6% + Cocaine 68%

   Comments: Our results offer directly the result of the salt as we're
   using a salt as reference standard.

   UnderGroundCoco’s Peruvian Batch
   1st Week of Match 2017

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC

   This is a review for the batch of cocaine received from UnderGroundCoco
   the first week of March 2017.

   It was a couple months ago when I first heard from UGC and he asked
   about doing having a CCC review done. At the time I was being cautious
   and said I wanted to wait to see how some of his packages going to the
   USA end up by watching the various forums. I already had known that he
   was shipping from South America. Now I can confirm that it came from a
   “safe” SA nation.

   In fact, it came quite cleverly to my drop and I would not hesitate
   ordering again from him personally because of the packing and stealth
   methods. It came sort of like the packs I get from C_S. When I took the
   first barrier (which included mylar) out from the pack, you really
   could not smell anything, but once the first layer was peeled back
   there was this strong perfume-like smell. Then there was another sealed
   plastic barrier and inside that was the product.

   Let me say right now that I am very sensitive to perfume and I do not
   like it. I avoid women that reek of it! That’s all I can smell when I
   get near this batch of cola, is the perfume.

   This batch has a very different shade of color between a grayish-brown
   and beige. I’ve not seen any cocaine like this in a long time, decades.
   My guess is that this cocaine was turned into or mixed into a product
   that could then be smuggled more easily from point A to point B. It
   started off white, turned into something, then later extracted from
   that something and this is the color that it became.

   x576

   Think movie “Traffic” with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas.

   That being said, the good ole fingertip test passed with flying colors!
   It melted like butter leaving a thick, smooth, and clear oil slick on
   my fingertips with nothing left to see as residue. Then did the gummy
   and YUK! Proper numb, but I do not care for the perfume.

   The stuff beautifully disappeared with the water test. Just two drops
   on the small amount I tested and it was all but gone, a slight wiggle
   got the rest to go clear. Again, the odor was the perfume and I could
   not get past that to detect any other odors that it might have had.
   Same YUK and a good and properly time numb in my mouth when I licked
   it. There is of course that good ole coca alkaloid bitterness to it
   too. By the end of these two simple tests, I knew this was potent yayo.

   x696

   As you can see from the images, the stuff came in tiny pepples and
   powder as the envelop that I receive was completely flat and nothing
   detectable from the outside. I was sent 3.5 grams and it came packaged
   well. It is easily chopped up into a nice snortable powder with a razor
   blade and with care nothing should fly away.

   Something told me to be easy with this stuff until I could properly
   gauge it for myself. So just one medium sized line and it was about
   eight minutes later I was feeling a very nice affect coming on. Within
   15 minutes there was a very uplifting euphoria about me. But damn, the
   smell and taste of this going up my sinuses is something I do not care
   for.

   The first day of trying this batch I had to stay home for a while and
   get some things done before going out. Happily getting my work done, I
   noticed that I would go at least a hour between a single medium line
   before even thinking about it again. Then I would just go back to what
   I was doing and it would be about another 30 minutes before enjoying
   another line.

   Then it was time to go out and I do not usually ever do “bumps” when I
   do go out, so this time I did a line that was about 50% more than the
   last few. That certainly sent me flying and I was good to go for some
   time while at my local pub for a couple of pints of ale.

   Over the next couple of days, I have indulged a few more times with
   UGC’s batch. I truly like its affects, it is very nice cocaine, but the
   taste and the smell is a bit of a negative. Once I have done a few
   lines, that taste just stays on the back of my throat.

   I’ve got to break out the old “lab” gear that I have and do an acetone
   wash on the rest and then see what happens. Just recently got me a new
   bottle of lab grade acetone and some lab grade calcium chloride.

   A sample was sent to Energy Control a few days ago now and the EC code
   is: ZLDG5117

   For the money that UGC is charging, as well as the stealth that is
   being used, I would have to say that this is worth a try. My package
   arrived in about twelve days to the Midwest USA. There’s been others
   that have reported their in transit time was nearly double, but that is
   not on UGC.

   When the EC test results arrive, I will post them here and on all the
   forums.

   UGC can be located at the following marketplaces:

   Well finally on March 29, 2017 I am able to post the results of the
   laboratory testing done by Energy Control. And this is the very reason
   why I want to see all the DNM vendors have their products lab tested.
   They might think they have a very good idea of the percentage and
   whether or not there is any levamisole in the product, but unless they
   have preformed an actual laboratory testing, then they will never be
   sure.

   This was copied and pasted from the email that I received from Luis at
   Energy Control:

   Sample Code: ZLDG5117
   Substance: Cocaine
   Lab Code: 103210
   Result: Levamisole 5%
   Cocaine 70%
   Dimenhydrinate
   cinnamylcocaine

   Our results offer directly the result of the salt as we're using a salt
   as reference standard. Qualitative analysis was performed with GC/MS.
   The quantitative result was obtained using a calibration curve from a
   reference standard.

   FishWithScales Batch of Cocaine end of October 2016

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC.


   This review comes a couple days later than normal. It was the Halloween
   weekend when this fine batch from FishWithScales (and known on the
   Dream market as "ScalesWithFish") and it was a busy weekend. Then I had
   a little mishaps that kept me from the computer for a day.

   This sample is already on its way to Energy Control though I was told
   the other day that this batch is already sold out! It arrived the day I
   thought it would, but through a little miscommunication with my drop, I
   did not get it until the following day. Packaging and shipping by FWS
   was just fine for my drop. However there was no decoy.

   Since this was coming on a big party weekend I asked for an extra gram,
   for a total of three grams and I am paying part of the $125.00 that is
   sent to the Avengers Forum to pay for the testing and the PDF and to
   put about $40.00 into the kitty for random testing.

   At this moment this vendors URLs are not available because he is in
   “vacation mode” until he re-ups and then I will post those URLs for his
   stores on Dream and AlphaBay markets.

   This came in just about two gleaming pieces and was just a beautiful
   example of fish scale, as you can see by the images. It did not have a
   strong odor, just a mild slightly chemical smell. The texture was like
   hard soap, the kind you just love to shave down with a razor blade to
   bring out the fluffiness. When the texture is like this, I rather play
   with it first and then hot plate the results.

   FWSOct2820160906x677

   First the finger test. Just a little between the forefinger and thumb,
   then pinch. Let the warmth of your fingers warm it up and it just
   disappears in a clear sheen. Rubbed that on my gums and soon that
   pleasant, just right numb came.

   Water test: Just a little it a spoon and add two drops of spring water.
   It all dissipated but a tiny trace of white specks. I noticed very
   little odor coming from it. Next, put it in my mouth and it was pretty
   darn cocaine bitter!

   Next to shave down come and try a line. This batch shaves out very
   nicely into fluff.

   Then a moderate sized line. About ten minutes later I was really
   starting to notice it and an nice euphoria coming on. The snort was
   very smooth, no burn and almost like as if you’re snorting fluffy air.
   At about twenty minutes I was very nicely buzz and ready for a party
   night! It was less than an hour later when I did the second line and
   silly me, the line was just a little bigger than the last.

   When that caught up with me a few minutes later I knew that this was a
   potent batch and there was no need for medium or large sized line, but
   just bumps or small lines will do the trick. Throughout the evening
   just a bump here and there worked for a few quite pleased people.

   That night there was no problem to sleep, nor any problems with the
   sinuses. Woke up after sleeping in somewhat feeling great and only had
   to clear my nose once and no sign of anything but normal clear mucous.

   The following evening I decided to try some while working at the
   computer, knowing I just needed a little at a time. Man! The work flew
   by and I was bumping at about 90 minutes intervals and it was very
   smooth sailing. That took me through the night.

   The next day I checked in with a couple of the friends that were also
   trying this batch out and they were raving about it!

   It seems to be a very fine example and it appears to be clean too.
   However I am learning that I will never know for sure until we see the
   lab test results, which will be a couple weeks away from this posting.

   FWSOct2820164906x677

   OnionCola’s Cocaine Review Section - 2016

   June 2016

   Hello everyone and welcome to the new Cocaine Vendor Review Section!

   I have recently started a new review and testing “program” in which
   I’ll be working with the DNM Avengers! This is primarily for all the
   newer cocaine vendors on the DN, but also is welcome to all DN cocaine
   vendors that would like to get more exposure on the Dark Net Markets.

   So how does this all work?

   This is not just a review opportunity, but a new means in which the
   vendor can then possibly be able to place an ad on this website! So
   this is not your ordinary ad placements.

   In order to start such a review, the vendor must contact me via
   onioncola@protonmail.ch or one of the forums’ PM and using PGP in order
   to make the arrangements. Because of recent situations, we are now
   conducting the payment for the Energy Control testing and PDF results
   and the DNM Avengers Forum donation as such:

   What is required is 1) a $130.00 donation/payment per sample to be
   tested, 2) two grams of the product to be reviewed

   The BTC payment will be made to me and I will then make the payment
   requirements for Energy Control testing plus the PDF. Energy Control
   charges a total of 80 Euros for the testing and PDF. The balance of the
   $130.00 goes towards the Avengers’ “kitty”, minus whatever the mixing
   fees are too. So that is about $40.00 towards the kitty. For the time
   being until the DNM Avengers get a new donation fund set up, the vendor
   must pledge $40.00 towards the DNM Avengers Forum random testing
   program once it is started up again.

   Within usually 24 hours of receiving the product, I will have a sample
   going out to Energy Control. If I receive the sample on a Saturday
   would be the exception and then it goes in the Monday’s mail.

   Then I start examining the product, taking pictures and making a
   several day review of that product. I post the images and review on
   this website, as well as the DNM Avengers forum and the market forums.

   Also this might hopefully help to set a standard. You might say that
   the vendors are going to send their best stuff, before they cut it. But
   if they send me something that is reviewed favorably, then everyone
   should expect the same product/quality. If we can then have follow up
   anonymous testing/s of the same vendor’s batch, we will see if these
   vendors hold true.

   This can be a very good means to get better exposure on the DN Markets
   for a new vendor or even one that has only been known on one market and
   wants to expand to more markets. The Concerned Cocaine Citizens Onion
   website is two years old now and many savvy cocaine users visit this
   website.

   In the near future I hope that there might be a qualified reviewer in
   Europe that can help in this project.

   If you are a vendor, you can contact one of the Admins of the DNM
   Avengers and they will confirm this.

   Thanks to everyone and may a better DN Market cocaine situation become
   of this!

   TopTierDrugs’ Colombian Batch
   3rd week of December 2016

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC.

   This review for TopTierDrugs took a little time to begin because TTD
   contacted me through his own research, before he ever had a sale made
   on the DNMs. He wanted me to do a review and send a sample off to
   Energy Control in first contact with me, but I was not willing to do
   this until he would first be verified as a vendor on the DNM Avengers
   Forum and then had a few sales and good comments about him. Then I kept
   an eye on this vendor and he did soon after our initial messaging
   contact the Admins at the Avegners and got his verification there. A
   couple weeks later I saw he was making some sales and there were some
   good comments coming in over the forums about this new American based
   cocaine vendor. Of course we are all looking for more good, consistent
   cola vendors to appear here on the DN, so I contacted TTD and said
   let’s do it.

   His pack arrived very quickly once he said he was sending it. It was
   good packaging for my drop situation. Three barriers plus padding used,
   but no decoy of any type. It sure would be nice if all the vendors were
   to just get in the habit of adding clever decoys as part of their
   routines in shipping. It is not that difficult to come up with
   different means of decoying and not spend a lot on the process.

   The sample came in at 2 points over the required amount of two grams.
   This sample came as beautiful fish scale with just the right amount of
   shine and shape. It chopped up perfectly with a razor blade and into a
   nice fluffy “snow” which looks very much the same as JSL’s newest
   Peruvian. The odor of the product itself is noticeable when opened, but
   just slightly so.

   x677

   The finger test came out just as we would like to see it done. Slick,
   clear, shiny oil left on the finger tips with no noticeable residue.
   The numbness from the “rub” was mild and had the correct timing. Does
   not seem to have any added “caines”. The taste just mildly bitter.

   I only took about a 1/4 of a small line and put that into a spoon and
   dropped just two drops of distilled water onto the substance. Only
   about 1/2 of it disappeared on its own and it took repeated agitation
   to get the rest to disappear, but when it did dissolve there was no
   trace of residue left. The cocaine water gave off a slight
   petrol/chemical odor, nothing that would just jump out at ya though.
   When I tasted the water, it was a mild to medium bitterness and I think
   I noticed a slight taste of saltiness too. It seems like there might be
   something in there that dissolves with water, but not as quickly as
   does the yayo.

   When doing these reviews and trying out a new batch, I try not to ever
   start out with doing too much, so I use moderation and just small to
   medium sized lines and only one at a time and spaced out so that I am
   not doing more than one dose per 45 minutes. So the first day I took it
   easy as I had to go out and get things done in real life around people
   that are not cool.

   x532

   The initial introduction to my sinuses was very light and smooth going
   up. No sort of burn or irritation was noticed, but soon after that
   nostril started to run a little noticeably. I was feeling the first
   toot at about the eight minute mark and at about the 12 minute mark I
   could feel a niceness, a clear feeling of euphoria coming on. After the
   3rd dosing I was happily getting my errands done and figuring out the
   rest of my day. There was no edginess or hyperness. The “drip” was very
   light and with no gagging.

   On the second day of testing this batch out my nostril started to run
   noticeably after the second snort. It would clear up after about 15
   minutes and would start again after the following doses. When I woke up
   on the 3rd morning there was a fair amount of clogging of the sinuses
   which I was able to relieve by having to blow my nose a few good times.
   Let it be known though that I do have a bit of sinus problems in the
   winter and that everyone’s body/system reacts differently with
   identical substances.

   x703

   For being a Colombian cocaine, this is quite mild to me and makes me
   think it is more like a Peruvian origin. The kilo stamp shown on TTD’s
   store shows that it is of a Colombian origin, or at least it was
   shipped from there. True that I have not gone at this batch hard, like
   in a party mode as some folks might during a fun, safe night out. It
   works well as a “need to get some real work done” type of cola, but I
   am not sure if this is as strong as some people expect a Colombian
   batch to be.

   Though this batch seems to leave me a little “stuffy” the following
   day, I do not notice any other adverse effects. A sample was sent to
   Energy Control the very next day after receiving this from TTD, the
   payment to EC was made that same day, as well as a $40 donation to the
   DNM Avengers Forum by TopTierDrugs.

   Once the results come back from Energy Control this review will be
   updated, as well again once the PDFs are received as well.

   JetSetLife’s Peruvian Batch
   2nd week of December 2016

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC.

   JSL's package arrived looking like normal Priority Mail Express, so
   therefore the labeling was hand written, but it certainly did not look
   suspicious or the like. All the barriers were there and there was no
   reason to worried about this package arriving.

   This newest Peruvian batch of JetSetLife's is a nice chunky, off-white
   example of shimmering goodness! It seems to have just the correct shine
   to it and not suspect of being too shiny. When you open the final
   containing bag you can notice the slight mild odor of a chemical-like
   smell.

   It passes the finger tip test quite nicely, leaving behind a clear,
   shiny slick oil on my finger tips. Once rubbed on my tongue and gums,
   it slowly produces a mild, pleasent numbing. The taste is all alkaloid
   bitterness, but not overwhelmingly so.

   x577

   Then onto the water test and I take about what would be an average
   small to medium line and put that in a spoon, then add just two drops
   of water. The vast mjority of it just dissipated in the water and it
   only took a little movement to dissolve the rest. Just a very, very
   trace amount of clear residue is even noticed under a bright light. The
   smell that comes off this is a slight chemical and diesel smell, very
   slight. Looking good so far! Then I put that coke water into my mouth
   and it was not a powerful alkaloid bite, but rather a mild one. After a
   couple minutes my mouth went numb, not too much, nor was it too little
   a numb. Just what I sort of expected for a batch of Peruvian.

   x614

   Next up, the razor blade. I like to use a razor blade for chopping
   these batches during the review process so that I can maintain a
   consistent way of seeing things batch to batch. This batch is certainly
   not like the softer batches that sort of shave down like hard bar soap,
   nor was it rock hard and brittle. The texture was so that a slight
   amount of pressure or chopping action broke the pieces down into
   smaller and smaller fluffy pieces. As the pieces got smaller and
   smaller, the appearance was like soft, fluffy snow popping up at you!
   I’ve seen some nice reactions this year via the razor blade, but this
   is the only batch I seen do the powdery snow-like piles of
   wonderfulness. This is damn pretty! I have included a couple images of
   this, but I can not truly get the full appearance via my camera.

   x1

   Time to try a small line: Very smooth going up, very light, almost like
   not snorting something, but like lightly breathing in something. I
   noticed a very slight taste/smell of diesel fuel, but it seems that I
   can pick up on the diesel more so than most people. It certainly was
   not a negative factor. About ten minutes later there was a smile coming
   over my face as I started to notice the euphoria creep up. This is the
   type of cocaine I like best, the cocaine that is not jolting or making
   you having to keep your body moving in order to enjoy it.

   x513

   After trying this batch out several times, I truly believe this batch
   to be of Peruvian origins. Though this might not be the exact strain
   that is used by Coke Cola, it is probably very close to it. Quoted from
   the “Cocaine Handbook - An Essential Reference”, Chapter One:

   “On the desert coast of Peru and in the adjacent arid valley of the Río
   Marañón, a variety of E. novogranatense is grown. It has been named
   Trujillo after the region in Peru where it is grown. The leaves of E.
   novogranatense var. truxillense provide only 5% of Peru's annual
   harvest, and most of this is exported to the United States for use as a
   flavoring agent in Coca-Cola. The remaining leaves are locally consumed
   (chewed) by natives who value them for their great aromatic qualities
   and palatability.”

   Unless you truly over do it, this is the type of cola that does not
   give you an edginess, make you grind your teeth or make you go hyper.
   It is nice, euphoria, mellow buzz. I find that there are two type of
   cocaine connoisseurs, those that love the smoothness of Peruvian and
   then those that like the cocaine that has more of a “bite” and zip to
   it, like that from Colombia. This is the perfect stuff to get lots of
   work done all day and be happy at the end of that day.

   I have had no problems eating or sleeping with this batch. My friend
   was amazed at how mellow it was, while thoroughly enjoying it. She
   ended up getting a lot of “craft” work done on it. The drip is quite
   mellow and does not make one gag.

   One medium sized line per 60 to 90 minutes was all I needed to re-up.
   There was no fiending or the like. In fact, I would find myself going
   away with my work and then be surprised that nearly 90 minutes went by
   since the previous line! And that is exactly what you want from a nice
   batch of Peruvian.

   While doing this batch, my sinuses seem to be clearer than usual and I
   have not had a clogged nose later, nor any other negative after
   effects.

   x646

   A sample has already been sent off to Energy Control and I’m looking
   fowards to see those results. Once I get the email from Luis, I will be
   updating this review. Once the PDFs arrive, they will be posted to the
   CCC review page.

   If you are an older and more experienced cocaine user, I think you will
   find this batch to be quite delightful, but if you are a younger person
   and looking for the more zippier type of cola, then I would think JSL’s
   Aruba batch might be a better “fit” for you.

   Also please be aware that very soon JSL will also be on the Hansa
   Marketplace, which in my opinion is a safer marketplace to be shopping
   at.

   I noticed that JetSetLife’s stores are still listing the Peruvian as
   being 95% with no active cuts. Please be aware that this batch of
   Peruvian has not been lab tested yet and that batch that was tested at
   95% was back in June 2015.

   TopTierDrugs Cocaine
   2nd Week of March 2017

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC


   This is a review of the sample of cocaine that I received from TTD late
   the first week of March. By the time I received this sample and sent
   some off to Energy Control for laboratory testing, I was told by TTD
   that he was about to run out of this batch as sales were going better
   for him now than he anticipated.

   This new batch is very close to the previous batch that I reviewed a
   month or so ago, only I notice a bit more of a diesel-like smell and
   taste to it than the last, but just slightly. The product came in
   small, gleaming chunks of pearlescence that looks truly beautiful, as
   can be seen with the images here.

   The “between the finger tips” test proved out to be very positive, as
   the little chunk just kept dissipating into a clear, shiny, slick sheen
   with no residue left behind. The taste on the lips and gums from the
   “numbie” was a strong alkaloid favor and it became a proper numb within
   a few minutes later. No real nastiness in the taste.

   Because I used a little chunk for the water test, it took just slightly
   longer for the chunk to melt into clearness than it would had I added
   it as a powder. It was all but gone in a few seconds and a slight
   amount of movement. There was a slight odor of diesel and a chemical
   like smell. At this point, I knew this was going to be another
   impressive batch to deal with and I got in touch with TTD and bought
   some as soon as he said it was going to run out before my review was
   kicked out and especially before the Energy Control test results come
   out.

   x526

   (But this is what we all want here! Vendors that are concerned enough
   about their product that they are still willing to have their products
   tested and have the results go public, though that batch might be gone
   by the time the results come back. When vendors keep doing this, it
   shows that they care and they are trying to obtain what is truly safe
   to ingest. It is this very type of vendor on the DN that will make the
   DNMs safer than the streets.)

   The Energy Control code for this test is ZUTI6410.

   Since I have been very busy IRL and since I knew the batch would be
   gone quickly, I had to put this review on the back burner to take care
   of some other things, including Moderating the DNM Avengers Forum to
   wipe out the bogus vendors, spammers, scammers and fraudsters that
   showed up there in the last couple months.

   That being said, this batch has really kept me going over the last
   couple weeks in small doses, both at the computer for hours on end and
   also going out for a night’s worth of great entertainment. Everyone
   that has tried this batch from me has been very happy and impressed
   with it. I love how it chops up with a razor blade, as there is no real
   need to hot plate this batch, however hot plating would even make it a
   little better. If you’re located in a humid area, then hot plating
   might be necessary. The stuff just keeps fluffing out into nice shiny
   flakes of snow-like powder. It goes up very nicely with no burn or
   sting and just a slight diesel fuel smell and taste along with the
   obvious cocaine alkaloid effect that is to be expected.

   For me, in about eight to ten minutes I can notice it affecting my
   senses and it is nicely euphoric. I am not one to keep redosing like a
   fiend and this stuff lets me go for quite some time before I think
   about doing another line. Just a small to medium sized line is enough
   for me to get a bunch of work done for the next 75 or 90 minutes or
   more.

   x596

   I’ve always had a “sinus situation” my all my adult life that probably
   came from my father as he was always blowing his nose and sneezing
   regularly, especailly when in the direct sunlight. My sinuses will just
   drain for no reason, even when I was not doing coke for years. So this
   batch effected my sinus situation just a little, where I would
   sometimes get a nose run/drip within a couple minutes of snorting and
   sometimes in the morning when I wake, I would need a good nose blowing
   once to clear my sinuses completely. Most likely the majority of people
   using this batch will not notice that same effect.

   Something that I just thought about this batch: I have had very few
   drips at all and no gagging ones whatsoever!

   This batch is working out very well for me as it continues to be quite
   pleasant and I am able to get the work done that I got to get completed
   and when it is time to go out, this continues to be the right type of
   stuff to party on. Again this batch reminds me more of a Peruvian
   cocaine than a Colombian. Eating a couple full meals per day has not
   been a problem while partaking in this sample.

   If TopTierDrugs can keep getting batches like this one, he will be one
   of the top “to go to” vendors in the USA for cocaine.

   Well it took nearly one month to get the results of this batch’s
   testing for TTD and it is very close to being the same as the last!
   This posted on march 29, 2017. 76% cocaine with no active adulterants.
   The text below was copied and pasted from the Energy Control email I
   received:

   Sample Code: ZUTI6410
   Substance: Cocaine
   Lab Code: 103209
   Result: Cocaine 76%
   (no adulterants were found)

   Our results offer directly the result of the salt as we're using a salt
   as reference standard. Qualitative analysis was performed with GC/MS.
   The quantitative result was obtained using a calibration curve from a
   reference standard.

   JetSetLife’s June Review 2016

   Fair, honest, objective cocaine reviews by OC.

   This is the first of the reviews, this one of JSL’s Colombian batch.


   JetSetLife (JSL) Colombian batch LA REINA DE MEDELLIN

   Dream =[1]http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/viewProduct?offer=212760.505641

   This is the same review as was posted on the forums:

   This stuff comes out of the packaging with some nice fishscaly chucks
   and has a soft but tough texture. Whether you hot plate it or not
   (though you might want to hot plate it if you can) the chucks just keep
   shaving into fluffy pieces and it does not really powder out into a
   fine dust like a lot of cut shit will.

   Mind you, this is not the smooth and mellow Peruvian, which I honestly
   more prefer, this stuff has a nice “hardness” to it. This is the stuff
   that you want to go out and PARTY with, whereas the Peruvian is more
   sweet and mellow, the kind of stuff that you can just kick out the work
   while on the computer and time flies.

   If you have a tendency to get chatty on some colas, then this is that
   kind of stuff.

   This leaves a nice oily sheen on your fingers when you rub a little
   between them. The taste is that bitter cocaine taste with just a very
   slight tinge of petroleum to it. The numbness is right on time, strong
   and natural. When you add a couple drops of water to some, the cola
   quickly disappears and there are just slight traces of anything left
   behind.

   If you are snorting be careful to start off with small lines as this is
   powerful stuff and not much is needed. It is smooth with just a bit of
   a bite going up the olfactory system. And you are feeling this about 12
   minutes later. The euphoria is there and it is enjoyable!

   Personally I try not to be a fiend even when it is around and I wait
   until I really think the next snort is needed. I go about 75 minutes or
   so on one small line.

   I would have to think that if this was freebased, it would certainly
   have more of a JOLT than JSL’s Peruvian. [2]JSLBanner7fs01400x200

   This is a top-tier product and it is being shipped from the USA! So if
   you are looking for a domestic (USA) vendor, then you ought to check
   out JSL’s colas. They might not be the cheapest on the DN, but when it
   comes to cocaine and you know your stuff, then you know that you do not
   want cheap, you want quality.

   But do not take my word on it, give it a try! JSL is doing a promotion
   to reintroduce himself to you all as one of the very best and
   consistent of all the USA cola vendors. Personally I have never had
   anything but excellent cola from him each time.

   Yeah, his English is not so good and sometimes he will go on vacation
   mode for a while, but when he is shipping, it’s been right on. The
   grams are priced at $120 on Dream:
   http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/viewProduct?offer=563525.477941 but an
   8Ball is only $245 and that is quite a good price!

   [3]http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/viewProduct?offer=212760.505641

   Since I wrote this review I got to enjoy this batch a little more and I
   found that if I just did a little less and went about two hour in
   between small lines, I was able to kick out the work on my computer and
   just sit there enjoying it and getting shit done.

   Jcopy bcopy

   This is the same image, just developed two different ways and that
   might be the best way to give you a better idea of what this stuff
   looks like.

   June 18, 2016 = I just got the results back from Energy Control on this
   batch of Colombian Cocaine from JetSetLife and this is the exact cut
   and paste from their email:

   Sample Code: LV091

   Substance: cocaine

   Lab Code: 98728

   Result: Levamisole 3% + Cocaine 84%

   Our results offer directly the result of the salt as we're using a salt
   as reference standard. Qualitative analysis was performed with GC/MS.
   The quantitative result was obtained from GC/MS using a calibration
   curve from a reference standard.

   Reports will be sent next week.

   Once I get the PDFs sent to me, I will post them also.

   Folks it took way too long to get the PDF results back from Energy
   Control this go around, but that is how it happens at times.

   BC-Best-Exports Peruvian Review - January 2017

   Fair, honest, objective cocaine reviews by OC

   This is the late review for BC-Best-Exports batch of Peruvian Cocaine:

   This is the oddest situation that I have had for a cola review yet for
   the DN. BC-Best-Exports and I started talking abut doing this review a
   couple months ago and then several things hung this up. So I actually
   received this sample about two months ago, but between communications,
   illness with both the vendor and myself, delays in the payment to EC
   and then EC taking time off for the holidays, this review is just now
   reaching you, along with the PDF results.

   As moniker indicates, BC-Best-Exports is a Canadian vendor. His pack
   came in looking quite normal for business mail, and it would not be a
   problem for most people to receive with no suspicion. But there was not
   a decoy employed.

   Everything was well sealed and this should be fine for now as far as
   going through Canada to USA mailing systems. The grams came in two
   separate tiny little zip baggies that were completely packed where no
   more could fit in them and each contained exactly a gram. Pretty
   clever.

   x561

   The cocaine looks a little “chalky” in texture, very dry and brittle
   upon arrival. A dull, off-white with sparkles. This is the type of look
   and texture that can fool you as it can be rebricked or it can be the
   real deal. With this batch one has to be careful not to send pieces
   flying when trying to use a razor blade.

   The finger tips test came out as one would want it to be, the thick
   white powder in short time went into a nice, clear, oily slick on my
   finger tips and then gave a proper numb, not too quickly or too
   powerful. The smell was that of a cocaine chemical smell and I did not
   detect any petroleum.

   The water test of a small line and two drops of water had the substance
   disappear into clearness in a short time with just a little movement
   added to the mix after a couple seconds and there was no residue left.
   The water was a strong bitterness that certainly does represent
   cocaine.

   x548

   The timing of this review originally was not good because I came down
   with a sinus infection and a cold at the same time and it started
   within the same day of first trying to review this batch. My sinus
   infection happened so closely to the same time as first snorting some
   of this, I thought I was having an adverse reaction to this cola.
   Therefore I had to stop reviewing and recover. About at the same time
   the vendor was going through an illness as well. And it took more than
   a week before he sent the payment to the Avengers.

   We decided that rather than me come out at that time and pan this cola
   without knowing for sure if I was reacting to it, that I would wait for
   the results from Energy Control to come back. I thought that was only
   fair. Since then I have been able to review several more batches of
   other vendor’s cocaine without any problems.

   Once I got the PDF results back from Energy Control I said it was now
   time to finish this review. This batch of cocaine is as I said, dry,
   hard and brittle, but being careful, it does chop up nicely with a
   razor blade. It “chops” and does not shave the cola.

   My second time around with this batch was much better and I am sure now
   that it had nothing to do with my sinus infections earlier and rather
   bad timing.

   The cola is very smooth going up and it is a nice, euphoria buzz that
   does remind me of what a Peruvian ought to be like. The effects last a
   nice amount of time and I personally do not like to redose until the
   effect of the last snort is basically about gone and I then remember to
   do another. I was able to get my office work done nicely with this
   batch, as well as having a fun night out with some friends without
   other “knowing”.

   x630

   It seems that when cola comes into the USA from a different source than
   through Mexico, it stands a much better chance of not having any
   levamisole in it and such is the case with this nice batch of cocaine.
   Energy Control came back with the results of 81% cocaine and no active
   cuts! And for those that are wary about getting order overseas, this
   might be a better option to use.

   Sample code: CJ605
   Substance: cocaine
   Lab code: 101456
   Result: Cocaine 81%
   Comments: Our results offer directly the result of the salt as we're
   using a salt as reference standard.

   Please see the amazing series of articles by “The Stranger” a free
   weekly from Seattle as they wrote about how levamisole first appeared
   in cocaine and why it might not be found in the batches arriving
   directly to Canada, Africa and Spain.
   [2]http://cocaineo5z66elwy.onion/Levamisole-The-Mystery-of-the-Tainted-
   Cocaine.html

   Since it is a BITCH to be able to consistently order levamisole-free
   cocaine from the USA based vendors, this might be something for us all
   to be checking out at $80 per gram! He can be found on AlphaBay:

   JetSetLife - Bolovian Batch of Cocaine October 2016

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC.

   This review is on the new Bolovian batch of cocaine from JetSetLife
   (JSL) that is available on both the Dream and AlphaBay Markets: Dream:
   1 gram =
   [2]http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/viewProduct?offer=664842.362276
   JSL’s vendor link =
   [3]http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/contactMember?member=JETSETLIFE
   AlphaBay: 1 gram =
   [4]http://alphabaywyjrktqn.onion/listing.php?id=210915
   JSL’s vendor link =
   [5]http://alphabaywyjrktqn.onion/user.php?id=jetsetlife

   I received the package on the day that I expected it to arrive, three
   days time. Received what was supposed to be an 8ball, but it was
   actually 3.9 grams! The sample has already been sent off to Energy
   Control for testing via a DNM Avenger Forum’s test code, so the results
   will be a part of the DNM Avengers Forum, as well as on this website.

   The stealth was good in getting here, nothing suspicious and there was
   PRINTED labels used! JSL told me that he is using several methods of
   stealth now. Absolutely no odor to be detected via this shipping method
   which included multiple barriers. (but if someone else at your address
   were to open all the packaging the gig would be up. A last decoy
   barrier could still be employed, but how many vendors do do that?)

   Upon opening the last zip I saw what is a very pretty example of
   fishscale cocaine. I mean this stuff is beautiful in appearance! The
   odor I got from it when I opened it was a slight diesel and chemical
   smell, nothing heavy. When I took just a little amount, about the same
   as a medium line into a spoon and put just a couple drops of water on
   it, most all of it disappeared into the water and just a slight
   stirring and nothing was left but a few traces of specks. The odor that
   came from this, I was able to smell the diesel fuel a little more so.
   (Please keep in mind that essentially all cocaine these days is
   processed with a petroleum, either diesel, gasoline or kerosene.)

   When I put that solution into my mouth, there was a cocaine bitterness
   along with the distinct taste of diesel fuel. The numb was mild and on
   time. Did not seem to have anything fake to the numbness.

   At this point I should mention that I am very aware of the petroleums
   used in cocaine processing these days and I will usually pick up on
   this quicker than others. My friend that noticed this taste said he
   though that was the presence of ether, but no, ether is rarely used
   these days in South America. (Plus ether tastes and smells nothing like
   any petroleum.)

   The texture of this batch of cola is slightly soft, but you still have
   to be careful using a razor blade or whatever that you do not apply too
   much pressure and sent the stuff flying. With this type of cola texture
   I like to play with it and therefore I shave it down with a razor blade
   first before then hotplating it. (The hotplating helps the absorption
   of cocaine when it is in your nostrils. And for this batch when
   hotplating, it dries it out where it is not as fun to play with. Thus
   hotplating after chopping.)

   [6]JSLBanner7fs01400x200 Took a little and put it between my index
   finger and thumb and soon it was just a clear oil with a slight amount
   of residue left behind. It left a proper numb and tasted of diesel.

   Then the test, a medium sized matchstick line. It went up smooth, but
   immediately I also noticed the diesel present. This batch would
   certainly serve the purpose much better if you were to do an acetone
   wash on it first. (But such is usually true with every batch of cola.)

   My previous experience with Bolovian cocaine back in the day (the 70’s)
   was that the Bolovian usually had the best “bite” or “jolt” to it. But
   to me this batch of Bolovian is very nice, euprotic and mellow. It does
   not send you racing, but I have not done a real binge session with this
   batch.

   I ended up taking some out on a Friday night and sharing this with some
   friends. Everyone was not only impressed, they all wanted to buy all
   that I had and there was no way. There was not a single complaint by
   any of them and they were quite pleased and smiling through the
   evening.

   Usually I use my cocaine while I am home and on the computer, so I like
   it when the cola is euphoric and mild. With this Bolovian batch there
   are the qualities of a “partying” cola, was well as a serious get some
   work done on the computer “euphoric” cola. So I had a very nice time
   out on Friday.

   The next two days were busy days for me and so I have not had as much
   time as usual to use the computer and this batch at the same time, but
   when I have, it works out pretty damned nicely for me.

   When comparing between the very top of the Top Tiers, like JSL’s
   Peruvian, or C_S’s Peruvian, this is a step down, but just a slight
   step. Very enjoyable and all but the pickiest of bastards like me will
   find any complaint at all about it. Personally I have to give a high B+
   or maybe an A- to all that is available in 2016. There is nothing on
   the streets that would compare to this.

   Since I have never had all three of his batches together at once, it is
   difficult to make a “for sure” comparison, but I do think the Colombian
   and the Peruvian are a little better. But then again, I would have to
   think this to be a personal preference too.

   After a couple days of mildly using this batch, I have not had any
   problems the day after with my sinuses. Clear headed when I wake the
   next morning. Most always a few hours after finishing for the night I
   need to blow my nose out once. This weekend everything was clear and
   blowing my nose once was all I needed. Of course, I do some little warm
   saline drips during and after use.

   Overall this is a very enjoyable batch from a vendor that has been
   solid now for the last two years. Yeah, there’s been some people that
   have tried to bring down this vendor, but he keeps coming up with batch
   after batch of very solid product and almost always has several batches
   to offer at the same time.

   Truly JetSetLife is one of the few premier cocaine vendors based from
   the USA. And as such, I can totally recommend this vendor for your
   cocaine needs.

   As soon as the results come back from Energy Control they will be
   posted here and on the DNM Avengers Forum. It would be nice to see an
   Energy Control blind testing done on this batch too!

   JSLBolovianOct20169902x641

   My friend who will go by the name of DeepForest and is not on the DN
   did around 1/2 gram of this batch over the weekend and so he also wrote
   a review and this is it:

   This Bolivian fish scale cocaine is off the chain. (Hey that rhymed) I
   don't like to get into the details of why I like cocaine but here I
   will. Masturbating. Masturbating on cocaine is phenomenal when it's
   right. Well, I was able to achieve climax without touching my dick at
   all. Which I've only been able to achieve three other times in my life.
   So, that being said it was also a good comedown, I didn't experience
   any soreness or overall hungoverness. A great buy if you ask me. Deep
   Forrest out.

   UPDATE: The results have come in for this batch of Bolivian Cocaine
   from JetSetLife and unfortunately it contains a high percentage of
   levamisole!

   Sample Code: XB031
   Substance: Cocaine
   Lab Code: 100722

   MajorKey’s Batch of Cocaine October 2016

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC.

   This is a review on the current batch (2nd/3rd week of October 2016) of
   MajorKey’s cocaine.

   [2]http://alphabaywyjrktqn.onion/user.php?id=MajorKey

   [3]http://alphabaywyjrktqn.onion/listing.php?id=194366 one gram =
   $74.00

   [4]http://alphabaywyjrktqn.onion/listing.php?id=194370 3.5 grams =
   $300.00


   [5]http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/contactMember?member=MajorKey

   [6]http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/viewProduct?offer=259827.229789 one
   gram = $87.70

   [7]http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/viewProduct?offer=866320.606122 3.5
   grams = $300.00

   When it comes to these reviews, there is never a “rush” on my side to
   have the vendor send as quickly as possible or the like. For me, the
   “rush” does not start until after I receive the vendor’s package, then
   I give myself 24 hours or less to get that sample sent off to Energy
   Control.

   However MajorKey felt that he had forgotten to ship off to me for a few
   days and got back to me and said that he was sending an additional
   amount to make up for lost time. He certainly did not have to do this.
   The package then arrived when I thought it would with no problems.

   I have made a couple of minor suggestions of what could be done for
   better OPSEC and stealth and I think those suggestions will probably be
   taken. All along there has been good communications with MajorKey and
   he sounds like a vendor that wants to be seen as a serious cola vendor.

   When I got to the last bag the sample was in, there was an impressed
   smile on my face. This looked very, very nice and it was mostly all
   chunks. I would have to say though that the shine is maybe, just maybe
   a little suspicious, but all the same a very pretty appearance that
   reminds me of the cocaine of decades ago. It’s a beautiful example of
   “fishscale” and you can tell this is not something that has been
   rebricked a couple of times.

   MajorKeyOct20161906x655

   So the first thing I could notice was just a slight petrol and
   chemical-like odor, nothing strong. Next I did the finger tip test,
   just a “pitch” between the forefinger and thumb and it did not take
   long to break down into a very clear oil and no residue. Perfect. Of
   course, then I rubbed my fingers onto my gums and a good and right
   amount of numb showed up.

   Next I put just a little into a spoon and dropped some room temperature
   spring water on it. This batch might have the cleanest, fastest water
   test I’ve seen in a long time. A couple small drops of water and it
   just disappeared. The odor that came off from it was very faint and I
   really did not smell petroleum anymore and it was more like a clean
   chemical odor.

   So then what’s next? In the mouth the solution goes and there was a
   strong cocaine bitterness to it for sure. Wasn’t too long before a good
   and proper numb showed up along my gums, teeth and tongue.

   Now to play with those chunks! Folks, this is damned pretty cola and it
   deserves to be thoroughly enjoyed visually while properly shaving this
   into smaller and smaller lovely pearlescence flakes. Depending on where
   you live especially, this might need to be hotplated. I have found that
   when it comes to this type of texture of cocaine, I like to shave it
   down first and then hotplate what I am doing to do for that session,
   rather to hotplate it before shaving it down.

   Time to try out the this fluffiness! One average matchstick line up the
   schnozzola and it was very smooth, like next to nothing going up. It
   was about ten minutes, maybe a little less where I started to feel
   something creeping over me and it was not too much longer it was a nice
   feeling. I got a slight sweat on the back of my neck and my palms. It
   seems that I sort of pick up on the petroleums a little more so than
   others and with this batch I notice both diesel and I think kerosene as
   the solvents used to break down the leaves. (This is not a bad thing
   since all cocaine made in South America illegally is broken down with
   either diesel, gasoline, kerosene or a combination there of.) (But this
   is also another reason why all cocaine ought to have a final washing
   via acetome at some point.)

   MajorKeyOct20168906x1

   I also had some things to take care of and the next hour just flew by
   and before I knew it, it was time about 75 minutes later to do another
   same sized line. A few minutes and I knew I was liking this batch. I
   spent the rest of that first evening with this batch working on
   projects and the time just flew by and I was getting my shit done,
   really enjoying myself. Over the course of about 12 hours I did seven
   lines I think.

   During the course of that time, my sinuses stayed very clear, no
   stuffiness or problems. The drips that came were pretty mild and once
   you do this stuff for a few years, you can appreciate a good drip. This
   is a very enjoyable, clean, euphoric buzz.

   Now this will be different for each person of course, but each night
   that I did this over a period of hours, once I stopped and before going
   to bed, then my nose would start running some. And the next morning as
   I do every morning I clear my sinuses out by blowing kind of hard, but
   what is normal for me and each morning the initial blow contained a
   small amount of blood in the clear mucous. No bleeding and no more
   signs of blood on additional blowing of the nose. I feel I should
   mention this as it is the first time this year I have seen this. Again
   though I want to stress this was very minor, but something I noticed.
   And when I shared some with a good friend, he has the same reaction the
   next day.

   Also I want to mention that I regularly use a little saline before,
   during and after playing.

   The next day was a Friday and I thought that this should be shared with
   some friends. A few of my friends are closer to my age and others are
   of that age where they never saw the old days of ether based, acetone
   washed before leaving South America cocaine. So there is a good mix to
   go by. Everyone that saw it was impressed with its beauty.

   Throughout the evening there were some very happy faces! This is the
   kind of stuff that you can really enjoy out in public and be able to
   keep it together no problem. Of course, we were all using in
   moderation. I feel if you think you need to do a gram or more in a
   night, then maybe you ought to be seeking out a different drug than
   cocaine. There was not a slighting comment about this stuff the entire
   night.

   I have to say that after each night that I have played with this batch
   from MajorKey I have slept hard and heavy like a baby! Each time waking
   up feeling really good, no after effects the morning after.

   I’m not really able to guess as to its origin, because it almost feels
   like the good qualities of both a Peruvian and a Colombian cocaine
   combined. The sample was sent off to Energy Control more than a week
   ago now and I am looking forwards to seeing what the results for this
   batch is. Even if there is found to be a slight amount of active
   adulterant in this, I would have to say this is a very professionally
   put together batch of cocaine. Certainly we could use more examples
   like this coming from the American cola vendors on the DN. If we can
   keep this up, then the DN will be better and safer than the streets!

   This is one of the nicest examples of cocaine I have reviewed so far
   this year. Thank you MajorKey for your willingness to take part in our
   review process.

   MajorKeyOct20168906x809

   Folks, do not just take my word on this though, I am hoping that a
   blind test to Energy Control will follow up this initial testing. If
   everyone gets the same as I have here, everyone will be a very happy
   camper.

   About the three images above. I am not usually this lucky getting the
   exactness of what my eye sees to what the printed images look like. But
   these images truly represent what I and you will see with this batch!

   Also my friend “DeepForest” who I shared some with a couple times wrote
   his own little review that he would like to share as well:

   That there was some high quality stuff. Did a .25 gram and it lasted me
   all night. Once I was done with it I didn't feel the Jones for more, so
   that's good. Fell asleep like a breeze and I woke up 7 hours later
   feeling fully charged. Blew my nose first thing and had a tissue full
   of bloody snot but only from the one blow, after that my nasal passage
   was free and clear. I did have a slight sweat to my palms while using.
   Overall though really great stuff. Df.

   UPDATE December 23, 2016: I just got back the test results for this
   batch from Energy Control. It took way too long for the results to come
   back to me, but that is out of my control. This is what Luis sent to me
   via email:

   Sample Code: KM739
   Substance: cocaine
   Lab Code: 100895
   Result: Cocaine 69%

   Reports are suffering big delays because we are dealing with a huge
   amount of samples from people preparing their holidays, so we have to
   prioritize results over reports. But we'll send them as soon as we can
   manage!

   For an USA based cocaine vendor, this is not a bad test result. There
   were no active adulterants found, no levamisole!

   FishWithScales June Review 2016

   Fair, honest, objective cocaine reviews by OC.

   FWS and I had a few conversations first and agree on the review and
   testing arrangements. The package arrived as quickly as could be
   expected. For my type of drop, I really like how he/she packages their
   product. No decoy, but good packaging.

   There was two separate one gram paks inside and they looked damned nice
   just viewing them! Each gram had some very nice chunks of pearl white
   fishscale. Each one weighed right on point. Upon examination when
   opening one of the baggies I really could not get much of a smell to it
   at all. No petroleum odor was detected.

   This is very pretty stuff! It looks the way that true fishscale ought
   to look! Not molded and fake shiny, this looks to have multi-layers and
   the correct shine of cocaine.

   Fingers = Yes! I put a little between the thumb and index finger and
   lightly rubbed. It immediately turned completely into a very clear and
   smooth oil, no trace of powder left behind! Great numb, the way true
   cola should be!

   When you take a little chunk and start to chop it with a razor blade,
   it has that soft-hard texture to it, sort of like soap. It flakes out
   very nicely and if you can hotplate it, it makes it more manageable. In
   fact, hotplating this is recommended.

   A little bit of this with two drops of water made the stuff just about
   instantly and complete disappear into the water. Again I could not
   really detect much of a smell. The taste is cocaine bitter and no taste
   of fuel. The numb is nicely strong and you can just tell that this is
   probably a nice batch already.

   Take your time to properly and completely fluff this stuff out because
   it is that kind of texture. It turns into little flakes rather than
   powder. Upon taking in a small matchstick line, it goes up without a
   fight, without any stinging and seems smooth. This batch seems to then
   hit my throat a little quicker than some and the “change in attitude
   for the better” starts to hit at around the 8 minute mark or so for me.

   So I took my time and played with this wonderful batch for a few days,
   as well as shared with a good cola buddy. He was totally impressed by
   the stuff and amazed at how little it takes to go strong. In fact, he
   did the first small line and did not wait but five minutes before doing
   the next little line and then I could tell that he did a little too
   much at once as he was flying high!

   This is a batch that you want to use moderately until you get to know
   it. All you need is a little line/bump to go a long ways. I have been
   averaging 1.5 to 2 hours in between small single lines! My guess it
   that this is a Colombian cocaine.

   Towards the end of the day/night when it is getting time to say enough,
   I do get just a bit of a “spaciness” that I am not quite sure of. But
   this is certainly a batch worth checking out folks.

   The test sample is on the way to Energy Control ATM via the Avengers
   and as soon as I hear back from Luis and the Avengers, I will be
   posting the results, as well as the PDF on the CCC Onion website review
   section.


   Below is a quick review from my buddy “DeepForest” that got to try some
   the other night and is currently not on the DN:

   [1]FishWithScales1200x911 [2]FishWithScales1200x922

   When I first began purchasing cocaine from the dark web I immediately
   noticed a jump in quality from the garbage that I would buy on the
   streets. Having said that, the batch that I tested here was far and
   beyond my expectations.

   You could use a hot plate to dry it out a little more, but when you
   start chopping it up and it keeps growing and growing, it adds to the
   joy of the ritual. I used .4 grams and was lit up like a Christmas tree
   for hours and hours. If I had used street shit, I would have used 1.75
   and have wasted more money.

   Waking up was a breeze, didn't have a hangover and was fully energized.
   I give this an overall grade A.


   ~Df~

   On July 2016 I got an email from Luis of Energy Control and the results
   came back as:

   Sample Code: WS741
   Substance: Cocaine
   Lab Code: 99167
   Result: Cocaine 81%

   Our results offer directly the result of the salt as we're using a salt
   as reference standard. Qualitative analysis was performed with GC/MS.
   The quantitative result was obtained from GC/MS using a calibration
   curve from a reference standard.

   GiveMeSleep Cocaine Batch
   Last Week of April 2017

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC


   GMS contacted me a few ago about reviewing his product and once I
   checked out his sales on the DN, I decided on going for it. The product
   arrived via USPS Priority. The package came almost completely flat and
   appeared almost empty except for a noticeable lump in the middle of the
   envelop. I spoke to GMS immediately about this and asked him to up his
   shipping methods. It was also a hand written label, which has its pros
   and cons.

   I talked to him about things he can do to improve this and to even use
   a decoy and made several suggestions. After his replies back to me, I
   think he will not be shipping as such anymore and his methods will show
   an approvement.

   Now for the product. It was sent overweight by .38 grams, which is
   always nice. Product was in a little zip baggie inside of a mylar bag,
   inside a business envelop.

   item1

   The cocaine has a beautiful fishscale appearance to it. My smelling has
   been poor lately because of the pollen and shit that has been in the
   air for the last month or so, so there was only a slight chemical smell
   noticeable and not a petroleum one.

   item2

   The fingertip test went perfectly as the stuff just melted into an oily
   clearness with no residue. Then rubbing that onto my gums and tongue
   there was that old familiar cocaine taste and the numbness started to
   show up within a couple minutes. Not too much and not too little of a
   numbing.

   item3

   Next I took about third of a line worth’s and put it in a spoon and
   drop one drop of distilled water onto it and it started to melt away
   into the water clearly. Added one more drop and then just a slight
   movement and about 99% of it was gone. There was only a couple almost
   transparent flecks, so this was looking great so far! The slight smell
   that I could pick up was chemical like. Then I took the water and put
   it in my mouth. There was that old familiar cocaine alkaloid
   bitterness, but not overwhelming and the correct numbness happened a
   few minutes later.

   item4

   This batch chops up quite nicely with a razor blade, a soft crunch to
   it. It kept on flaking out into a nice fluffy pile. It gives no
   appearance that it has been “re-bricked”. It might be a good idea to
   try hotplating it, but not really necessary when I am located.

   Now for the real test, one small line up the old nozzola and it was
   very smooth. No burn or bite to it. It was about eight minutes later
   that I felt that cola pleasantness coming on and about another eight
   minutes later I was already beginning to tell that this batch has a
   nice euphoria to it. I had to get some computer work done after the
   line and this batch was great for moving me along in that direction.

   item5

   After a couple minutes the side that I snorted with would drip a
   little, which happens a lot for me. It is a noticeable drip and so I
   have to keep that in check. So I use a little warm water and sniff it
   into the nostrils. A few minutes later I use a saline nose spray and
   that really helps to keep things in check as far as the condition of
   the sinuses.

   I forgot about it for about the next hour before realizing that 60
   minutes or so had already passed, but I did not have that urge to re-up
   a line until about 45 minutes later. The next line was a little bigger
   than the previous and I then realized that it was almost more than I
   could use while sitting down. My advice is to start off in small
   amounts and gauge yourself as to the proper dose for your needs.

   After the first day of use, just five small lines in eight hours, I
   called it a night and went to bed. There was not a problem going to
   sleep. The next morning I had to clear my nose out with a good proper
   blow or two and there was a little thick snot, but then again, I have
   been fighting the sniffles and some cold-like conditions lately.

   Since I had the sniffles for the previous few days, I waited a day
   before “testing” the product again. There was plenty of computer work
   to be done and I was not going out, so I knew to use small dosages for
   the day. For that day I did a total of five lines over the course of 8
   1/2 hours and that pace worked perfectly for a good day of sit down
   work. It is amazing how when I find a nice batch it is about 90 to 120
   minutes later before I want to do another line. Time just moves right
   along and the work just flows. The next day went just about the same.

   Again when I would wake, I would need to clear my nose of the mucous
   that formed over the night. In the mucous was slight telltale signs of
   blood, but nothing to cause any alarm. Once the sinuses were cleared,
   all was good and I was back to fighting the shit in the air here.

   Folks this seems like a very nice batch of cocaine. I bet it is great
   batch to party on a it does have some strength to it when you bumb a
   little more than needed for sitting purposes. I have yet to try it out
   while ganging with the bar gang. If there is any levamisole in this
   batch, it is probably a small amount. The sample was sent out to Energy
   Control on May 1st and the sample code received is: ZUDE0878 Once the
   results are sent to me, I will post them here.

   GiveMeSleep also sent a sample into EC a week or so before me and that
   sample code is: YSOX3490

   You can find GMS on AlphaBay:
   [2]http://alphabaywyjrktqn.onion/user.php?id=GiveMeSleep

   Sample code YSOX3490 results May 5, 2017 = Substance: Cocaine, Lab
   Code: 103805, Result: Cocaine 81%

   The results for the sample that I sent to Energy Control came back on
   May 19, 2017 and those results are:

   Sample Code: ZUDE0878 Substance: Cocaine Lab Code: 104007 Result:
   Cocaine 73% Levamisole 5%

   Once the PDFs of these test results are received they will be posted
   here as well.

   KlassFlakko - DutchSnow Batch of Cocaine the last week of November 2016

   Fair, honest, objective Cocaine Reviews by OC.


   This is a overdue review for the batch of cocaine that
   KlassFlakko/DutchSnow sent to me about two weeks ago. I must apologize
   for the delay of this review, but there were several things happening
   IRL that really stopped me from getting the down and dirty stuff that I
   like to do done the last couple of weeks.

   AlphaBay Store:
   [2]http://alphabaywyjrktqn.onion/search.php?s_userid=klaasflakko

   About a month ago KF contacted me and asked me as an American cola
   reviewer to review the batch of cocaine he currently had in stock.
   Being that he is located in Holland and I was not familiar with him, at
   first I balked until I was able to vet him out via some of my fellow
   Euro cola reviewers. He got the double thumbs up and so I decided to
   see what getting a pack from Holland would be like. Granted, it makes
   me a little nervous to have something sent to me from a "flagged"
   nation.

   The pack arrived in very good time, about the same time frame as a C_S
   pack coming from Spain to the Midwest USA. But when I went to grab it
   up from my drop, I was a little more than shocked at how it was sent to
   me. I've spoken to KF about this and I do believe my pack was a bit of
   an exception than what is usual from him. He tells me that normally he
   does the same as C_S does for shipping overseas and that is to grind
   the rocks into a powder and send it less conspiciously. Mine arrived
   with a very obvious lump.

   item1

   We talked about stealth and getting things through customs via various
   nations. He told me that using DVD cases was what he used to do, but
   then that was one of the things customs started to catch and he found
   that the least amount of packaging, but still doing it safely was
   working best for his shipping to the USA. Quite honestly, I do not know
   what would be the best approach for Holland to the USA, but I received
   the pack no problem.

   All the needed barriers were there, mylar heat sealed, vacuum sealed
   inside that and a little zip baggie inside that. Came like business
   mail. When it was weighed, it was right on point.

   As far as 2016 is concerned, this batch was the hardest, driest batch
   of cola that I have seen so far. Usually when it is this dry and
   brittle I am a little wary of what it might be and how many times it
   might have been "rebricked". But I already knew that this batch had
   been EC tested and passed the test nicely, as well as it being nicely
   reviewed by the Euro cola reviewers. I do believe this is the batch
   that was tested to be at least 90% cocaine with no active adulterants.

   About the only negative thing I can say about this nice batch of yayo
   is the above, the texture. I truly enjoy the cocaine that is slightly
   soft, but still hard, where it just shaves off in flakes and just keeps
   flaking down into fluff. I have fun just shaving the stuff down. But
   this is not that type of cocaine processing and it is the type that you
   must be careful with when trying to use a razor blade and is better off
   using a sifter/grinder of some type.

   There is a nice pearlescence throughout the nearly rock hard cola, but
   not overly so where it brings a concern that it might be an "added"
   shine. The finger test, where you put just a little dab between the
   fore finger tip and thumb disappeared completely within a few seconds
   into a nice gleaming clear oily film, which tasted nice (for cocaine,
   that is!). The numbing came on nicely and was not over powering, it was
   quite right.

   After the numbing went away I put a very small amount into a spoon and
   then watched it disappear with just a couple drops of distilled water.
   No residue was left and the odor was not very distinctive, more
   chemical than petroleum for sure, which is a good sign. Then the part
   which can be a real bummer sometimes, putting that spoonful of cocaine
   liquid in my mouth for a taste test and again check the numbing.

   item2

   It was the distinct taste of our favorite alkaloid, that's for sure.
   Bitter and strong, but that's what it is supposed to taste like. The
   whole of my mouth got the proper numbness and I knew that I was in
   store to be testing what should be a nice batch!

   Because of my IRL situation the last few weeks, I have not been able to
   "play" around as I usually do, so I was only able to do this batch in
   very small portions when I had the chance. Each time I did a small
   session of this batch I was home, having to get my work done and each
   time I would find myself just smiling away and singing out LOUD to the
   music playing and even getting up and dancing a couple of times. This
   to me was a very happy, euphoric "buzz" and I was able to get a lot of
   good work done.

   With some batches of cocaine you get these almost nasty "drips" that
   can just about make you gag. Not this stuff! It was a very mild, an
   almost pleasant drip, if there is such a thing.

   And this stuff did not do the "jonesing" like some colas can do. I
   would find myself forgetting that it was over an hour since the
   previous small line and when I found a point to break my work, then I
   would enjoy and reload again.

   Lately I have been lucky enough to review some very nice examples of
   cocaine and it is sometimes difficult to decide which I like better,
   when they are all darn good examples of the coca strains available in
   the World. I certainly have to recommend this batch of yayo to those
   that know their stuff. KlaasFlakko/DutchSnow has gotten some good
   reviews from the Euros for a while now, so this is a vendor that you
   would want to consider when looking for a quality example.

   The other thing that I would like to point out about this vendor is
   that the price point to quality is very good! His current batch of
   Bolivian is selling for $120 for TWO grams! And it was tested out at
   92%!

   The sample was sent to Energy Control well over a week ago now and it
   might even be there by now. It sometimes takes Luis a couple days to
   catch up with his emailing confirmations, so will check in with him
   later today. Once I get the results, I will be posting them here too.

   item3

   Check back here in a couple weeks to see the Energy Control lab test
   results in the PDF file format!

   UPDATE December 23, 2016: The lab test results from Energy Control came
   in today and this is what was sent:

   Sample Code: FK107
   Substance: cocaine
   Lab Code: 101485
   Result: Levamisole 4% + Cocaine 65%

   The Concerned Cocaine Citizens has be open to post ads for those
   cocaine vendors that have shown to be consistently dependentable and
   have received numerous positives reviews by the forums readers as well
   as by OnionCola.

   The first such cola vendor that asked to place an Ad Page for his
   Cocaine listings on the DN Markets is JetSetLife.

   As a cocaine advocate and reviewer, I started conversing with this guy
   more than two years ago now. English is not his primary language and
   mine is not Spanish, so at times communicating can take a little
   effort, but I have personally found this vendor to be a honest and
   trustworthy vendor.

   Please go to the DNM Avengers Fourm at
   [12]http://dnmavengeradt4vo.onion to find many reviews and comments
   about JetSetLife’s Cocaine. Usually there is at least two or more types
   to choose from.

   Currently JetSetLife has two DN Market stores, one of Dream and another
   on AlphaBay. He is offering Escrow only on AlphaBay, FE only on Dream.

   AlphaBay =

   There's an amazing series of articles on cocaine and levamisole that
   has been done by a publication in Seattle called "The Stranger".
   Written back in 2010/11, it is still very relevant to today's situation
   with levamisole showing up predominately in cocaine these days.

   The Mystery of the Tainted Cocaine a series of articles by Brendan
   Kiley:

   What's a drug used to deworm livestock—a drug that can obliterate your
   immune system—doing in your cocaine? Nobody knows.

   Part One originally dated August 19, 2010

   "A granulocytosis can kill you, but its symptoms are frustratingly
   broad. Some people's throats close up. Some people get diarrhea. Some
   people get skin infections, sores in their mouth or anus, or just a
   fever. Some people have it, don't know it, and get better without
   seeing a doctor. Some people don't see a doctor until it's too late."

   The Cocaine Trade

   The Mystery of the Tainted Cocaine, Part II: How It's Made, How It
   Moves, and Who Might Be Cutting It with a Deadly Cattle-Deworming Drug

   Part Two originally dated on November 4, 2010[5] MysteryPartTwo440x281

   "Once cocaine crosses into the U.S. over the Mexico border, dealers cut
   it with agents other than levamisole: flour, baby powder, Epsom salts,
   laxatives, lidocaine, chalk. The lore is that we get some of the worst
   product in the country—it gets cut and stepped on, mostly by Latino
   narcos, at every stop between San Diego and Seattle. Meanwhile, it's
   rumored that Vancouver, Canada, has far superior cocaine than we do:
   Asian gangs import product to Canada through Vancouver and step on it
   as it moves eastward. The Latino and Asian gangs are said to have a
   gentleman’s agreement that the U.S./Canada border is also a gangland
   border. Latinos won’t sell north and Asians won’t sell south. As one
   dealer put it, “If we see any of those Asian guys down here, they’re
   fucking dead."

   How to Use the Levamisole Test Kit

   The Mystery of the Tainted Cocaine, Part III

   Part There originally dated on November 11, 2010

   [7]MysteryPartThree309x400

   "As covered in the first two parts of this series, a dangerous—and
   mysterious—new cutting agent called levamisole has entered the cocaine
   supply. It's being cut into cocaine in Colombia (meaning that local
   dealers probably don't know any more about this stuff than you do).
   Levamisole is a medicine typically used to deworm livestock (cows,
   pigs, horses), but in humans it can trigger a catastrophic
   immune-system crash called agranulocytosis. Basically, levamisole can
   obliterate your white blood cells, leaving you vulnerable to
   infections. It's impossible to pin down exact numbers, but in the past
   few years, people have been hospitalized and several have died due to
   levamisole poisoning.

   Several sources—from federal government agencies to local doctors at
   Harborview Medical Center who are testing cocaine and cocaine
   users—estimate that around 70 percent of the U.S. cocaine supply is cut
   with levamisole. It's everywhere, from Seattle to France to the UK."

   Levamisole Test-Kit Recipe How to Make Your Very Own Levamisole Test
   Kit by Dr. Mike Clark and Brendan Kiley

   Warning! This is indeed nerdy!

   [11]kit570x370copy

   Dr. Michael Clark, a psychiatrist and molecular biologist at Seattle's
   Harborview Medical Center, invented a relatively cheap and easy-to-use
   street test kit to detect the presence of levamisole in - well, in
   anything. The kit requires no special, rare, toxic, or restricted
   ingredients and should be easy to assemble in most basic labs. Read
   through the recipe and make all solutions used before starting a test.
   They will stay good for several months - or even years - if stored in
   glass bottles.

   Ephedrinebanner1600x87
   pxEphedrine3dCP280x209

   One of the oldest medicinal herbs known to mankind is probably Ephedra,
   or ma huang as it is known in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). A
   member of family Ephedraceae, Ephedra sinica is the primary species
   that has been used in China for more than 5000 years and is still being
   used in Ephedra preparations and extracts all around the world.

   Although originally examined by Emperor Shen Nung (ca. 3200 BC), the
   use of ma huang as a stimulant and as an antiasthmatic was not
   documented until the time of the ancient Chinese Han Dynasty (ca. 207
   BC-220 AD). m2

   The pharmacology of Ephedra is complex, but for both traditional and
   more recent popular uses, the established pharmcological effects appear
   to be attributable to its ephedrine-type alkaloids, mainly (-)-EPH and
   (+)-PSE. Pharmacological studies of Ephedra began shortly after
   ephedrine was first isolated and were focused on the pure compound
   rather than on the whole herb extract. The other natural isomers of
   ephedrine were subsequently utilized in studies conducted around the
   turn of the century in China and Japan. It was not until the 1920s that
   the pharmacological study of Ephedra alkaloids has been introduced in
   Western literature. Current Western therapies utilize these two
   alkaloids (and until recently norephedrine, also known
   aspheylpropanolamine) in their optically pure forms or as their
   synthetic racemates. Due to their stability, they are often
   incorporated in oral dosage forms.

   m3 Many cases of serious adverse effects and even fatalities have been
   reported that were linked with Ephedra or ephedrine administration over
   the last ten years. Haller and Beoowitz published a review of 140
   reports of adverse events related to the use of dietary supplements
   containing Ephedra alkaloids that were submitted to the FDA between
   June 01, 1997, and March 31, 1999. m4

   Using a standardized rating system for assessing causation, 31% of the
   cases were considered to be definitely or probably related to the use
   of Ephedra alkaloid - containing supplements, and another 31% were
   deemed to be possibly related. Among these adverse events, 47% involved
   cardiovascular symptoms and 18% involved the central nervous system.
   Hypertension was the most frequent adverse effect (17 reports),
   followed by palpitations, tachycardia, or both (13), stroke (10), and
   seizures (7). Ten events led to death, and 13 cases produced permanent
   disability. Also, by the year 2000, the Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA) had received more than 1000 injury reports related to use of
   Ephedra products.

   From the Wikipedia:

   Adverse effects

   Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are more common with systemic
   administration (e.g. injection or oral administration) compared to
   topical administration (e.g. nasal instillations). ADRs associated with
   ephedrine therapy include:

   Cardiovascular: tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris,
   vasoconstriction with hypertension

   Dermatological: flushing, sweating, acne vulgaris

   Gastrointestinal: nausea

   Genitourinary: decreased urination due to vasoconstriction of renal
   arteries, difficulty urinating is not uncommon, as alpha-agonists such
   as ephedrine constrict the internal urethral sphincter, mimicking the
   effects of sympathetic nervous system stimulation

   Nervous system: restlessness, confusion, insomnia, mild euphoria,
   mania/hallucinations (rare except in previously existing psychiatric
   conditions), delusions, formication (may be possible, but lacks
   documented evidence) paranoia, hostility, panic, agitation

   Respiratory: dyspnea, pulmonary edema

   Miscellaneous: dizziness, headache, tremor, hyperglycemic reactions,
   dry mouth

   Contraindications

   Ephedrine should not be used in conjunction with certain
   antidepressants, namely serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
   (NRDIs), as this increases the risk of the above symptoms due to
   excessive serum levels of norepinephrine.

   Bupropion is an example of an antidepressant with an amphetamine-like
   structure similar to ephedrine, and it is known as NDRI. Its action
   bears more resemblance to amphetamine than to fluoxetine in that its
   primary mode of therapeutic action involves norepinephrine and to a
   lesser degree dopamine, but it also releases some serotonin from
   presynaptic clefts. It should not be used with ephedrine, as it may
   increase the likelihood of the above side effects.

   Ephedrine should be used with caution in patients with inadequate fluid
   replacement, impaired adrenal function, hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis,
   hypertension, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes
   mellitus, cardiovascular disease, during delivery if maternal blood
   pressure is >130/80 mmHg, and lactation.

   Contraindications for the use of ephedrine include: closed-angle
   glaucoma, phaeochromocytoma, asymmetric septal hypertrophy (idiopathic
   hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), concomitant or recent (previous 14
   days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy, general anaesthesia
   with halogenated hydrocarbons (particularly halothane),
   tachyarrhythmias or ventricular fibrillation, or hypersensitivity to
   ephedrine or other stimulants.

   Ephedrine should not be used at any time during pregnancy unless
   specifically indicated by a qualified physician and only when other
   options are unavailable.

   Recreational and illicit use:

   Anecdotal reports have suggested ephedrine helps studying, thinking, or
   concentrating to a greater extent than caffeine. Some students and some
   white-collar workers have used ephedrine (or Ephedra-containing herbal
   supplements) for this purpose, as well as some professional athletes
   and weightlifters. It is common for many athletes to use stimulants
   while exercising. Such use of ephedrine has been associated with
   stimulant dependence, as well as deaths from heatstroke in athletes and
   circulatory problems such as aortic aneurysm in weightlifters, though
   these side effects are rare.

   As a phenylethylamine, ephedrine has a similar chemical structure to
   amphetamines and is a methamphetamine analogue having the
   methamphetamine structure with a hydroxyl group at the β position.
   Because of ephedrine's structural similarity to methamphetamine, it can
   be used to create methamphetamine using chemical reduction in which
   ephedrine's hydroxyl group is removed; this has made ephedrine a highly
   sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of
   methamphetamine. The most popular method for reducing ephedrine to
   methamphetamine is similar to the Birch reduction, in that it uses
   anhydrous ammonia and lithium metal in the reaction. The second-most
   popular method uses red phosphorus, iodine, and ephedrine in the
   reaction.

   A note from the CCC:

   So we see that this substance has a long history of human use. We also
   can see that ephedrine may contribute to adverse conditions that do not
   mix well with cocaine use. This is indeed an active adulterant and as
   such should never be used to “cut a drug”. The fact that ephedrine can
   cause a significant rise in blood pressure and heart rate as well as
   heart palliations means that it can be a dangerous mix with cocaine.

   Oh and by the way ephedrine can be use to make methamphetamine. It is
   most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt and is
   easily found on the inter webs, especially the dark ones.

   As an alkaloid ephedrine has scientific medical/clinical use and the
   crystallization of this substance has much the same structure and
   appearance as cocaine. If you were to go to this page on the Erowid.org
   website, you can learn more:

   tml

   If you were to research this a little on the net you will see that
   there are constant busts happening around the World for ephedrine as it
   is used for many purposes on the illicit markets. Cocaine actually
   seems to be one of the drugs that less to do with ephedrine, compared
   to where else it is found, including the manufacturing of meth.

   Do a “news” search for ephedrine and you will see UFC Fighters getting
   busted for this stuff as well as pro baseball, basketball and hockey
   players all getting tested positive for the substance. There are
   nations that still allow the manufacture and sale of ephedrine such
   that it is being smuggled by the kilos across borders, as well as there
   being illicit labs making this worldwide.

   Dollars, $100 bills in fact? There is a long standing cash service
   being offered by “Gold” who has been on the DN since SR1 back in 2012.
   His service has a long and outstanding history to back him up.

   Though Grams needs to be serious updated, you can still see via Grams
   that he has been offering very reliable service as a cash out service,
   primarily for DN vendors:

   [16]http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/infodesk/vendor/0x17A8F24AD8AA7B17

   He has a storefront on:

   Please let Gold know that you found out about his services from this ad
   he placed here on the Concerned Cocaine Citizens Onion website. If you
   tell Gold that I sent you to him, he will give you a discount on your
   first transaction with him!

   Below is the product description from his storefront on AB:

   Why are you buying CASH from me?- I am the oldest most trusted CASH OUT
   SERVICE and using me avoids you from having to deal with bitcoin
   exchanges (Coinbase) and local btc.com which is not safe for the DNM
   user.

   Genuine USD Cash

   Limit quantity 2 per order

   All bills have been tested genuine and counted with a banking grade
   money counter. They are also recounted by hand for accuracy. In the
   event that 100's are limited, I may ship a small part of your order in
   the same dollar value in 50's or 20's. I will always combine multiple
   orders that go to the same address to save processing time. If you want
   them in separate shipments, please leave me a note with your shipping
   address.

   Shipping Methods

   USPS Express or Priority w/tracking FEDEX Standard overnight (1 day)
   *Free for orders over $ 10,000 if requested (Cannot ship to P.O. Box)

   If combined with another item (must have paid for shipping on another
   order) shipping is FREE Signature is always waived.

   When will my order ship?

   Because of how unique my business model is I must take extra care to
   assure I do not mess up an order for any reason- which takes
   preparation. After years of shipping 5-6 days a week, it became
   unsustainable, so over the years I have decided to ship Mondays and
   Thursdays with orders having to be received no later 9 pm the previous
   night. So for example, if you order on Fri or Sat I will ship Monday.
   If you order on Mon-Wed it will ship Thur. Because I do not ship daily,
   my stealth is impeccable- I typically use prepaid labels with tracking
   or IF REQUESTED I will use priority/express stamp with tracking and
   keep a consistent tracking series for each separate customer. Please
   let me know if you have a specific shipping request or method you
   prefer and I will do my best to accommodate you within reason.

   I will not tolerate scammers:

   By ordering, you agree if the package shows delivered, or is lost
   because of fake/incorrect address or fake name, or for any other reason
   the buyer would be at fault.

   This seems like not only a more safe way to cash out than dealing with
   carders, fake bank accounts, scammers and fraudsters, it is only a 10%
   fee! Most of the other “cash out” services that you find on the DNMs
   have a service fee of 30% and more!

   With Gold you get actual $100 bills sent directly to your drop! If you
   have a lot of BTC and need a means to turning it to cold, hard cash,
   then you ought to at least investigate this unique cashing out DN
   service.

   In a single-center review of cases, most patients who'd taken the
   adulterated drug not only had darkened skin lesions caused by blocked
   blood flow, but also had some form of end-organ damage, including blood
   in the urine and elevated liver enzymes, reported Lindsay Wilson, MD,
   of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, during a poster session at
   the American Academy of Dermatology meeting.

   Some patients also had a stroke within a few weeks of their initial
   diagnosis, and one had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within a few days,
   Wilson reported.

   Pearson said illicit drug manufacturers and cartels cut levamisole into
   cocaine because it is relatively cheap. “They're cutting it because it
   makes it lighter and fluffier.”

   According to the New England Journal of Medicine the drug is also
   speculated to enhance the euphoric effect of cocaine.

   But when levamisole is mixed with cocaine it has been linked to
   necrosis, killing skin tissue, and neutropenia, a disorder that reduces
   a person's white blood cells, making them more susceptible to
   infections.

   “We're seeing flesh-eating, especially when it's injected,” Pearson
   said, describing the effects of the necrosis.

   The Guardian, an article from March 2015 about the increasing use of

   Analysis of cocaine samples found 50 adulterants, or cutting agents,
   including Levamisole - a worming agent withdrawn from human use owing
   to side effects, the most serious of which was a depletion of white
   blood cells used to fight infection.

   Medium.com: Quite the interesting article about what was going on at
   Energy Control in April/May of 2015.

   “As if rotting skin wasn't enough, levamisole also prevents the bone
   marrow from producing infection-fighting white blood cells. "It's a
   little bit like having HIV," said Craft, adding that without medical
   attention, the condition can be fatal. "About 10 percent of those
   patients will die from severe infections. They may be walking around
   like a time bomb.”

   Our Ads Page

   We are now going to start placing ads on the CCC Onion website!

   This is a great opportunity for the new/newer cocaine vendors on the
   DN, as well as the established ones! But this is not your average ad
   placement offer!

   In order to place a cocaine vendor’s ad on the CCC Onion website, the
   cocaine vendor must agree to the following:

   To start such a review, the vendor must contact me via
   OnionCola@Sigaint.org in order to make the arrangements.

   What is required is 1) a $125.oo donation/payment to the DNM Avengers
   2) two grams of the product to be reviewed

   Once the Avengers receive the BTC, they will then send me the code the
   for Energy Control testing plus the PDF. Energy Control charges a total
   of 80 Euros for the testing and PDF. The balance goes towards the
   Avengers’ “kitty”. So that is about $35.oo towards the kitty. (Probably
   a little bit more than that since the Avengers get a discount on
   multiple testings.)

   Within usually 24 hours of receiving the product, I will have a sample
   going out to Energy Control.

   Then I start examining the product, taking HD pictures and making a
   several day review of that product. I post the images and review on
   this website, as well as the DNM Avengers forum, TheHub Forum and the
   market forums.

   If the review proves out favorable then the vendor has the opportunity
   to start placing monthly ads on the CCC website. The fee for these
   monthly ads are the same requirements as the first review.

   $125.oo worth of BTC to the Avengers and two grams sent to myself. With
   that monthly payment the vendor gets another review and EC testing.
   Even if the vendor is on the same batch of product, it will be
   interesting to see how the product varies within the brick.

   Also this might hopefully help to set a standard. You might say that
   the vendors are going to send their best stuff, before they cut it. But
   if they send me something that is reviewed favorably, then everyone
   should expect the same product/quality. If we can then have follow up
   anonymous testing/s of the same vendor’s batch, we will see if these
   vendors hold true.

   In the near future I hope that there might be a qualified reviewer in

   Tracing the Geographical Origin of Cocaine
   Cocaine carries a chemical fingerprint from the region where the coca
   was grown.


   TracingtheGeographicalOriginofCocaine2944x419

   Figure 1 Identification of geographic regions in South America where
   coca is commonly grown. Left, regions producing illicit cocaine; right,
   identification of cocaine-growing regions based on a combined model
   derived from carbon-and nitrogen-isotope ratios as well as abundance of
   minor alkaloid components. Squares, Bolivia; triangles, Colombia; and
   circles, Peru. Regions within a country are distinguished by black and
   white symbols. Trux, truxilline; TMC, trimethoxycocaine. Isotope ratios
   are expressed as (Rsample/Rstandard􀀂1)􀀃1,000‰, where R is the molar
   ratio of heavy-to-light stable isotope; standards for carbon and
   nitrogen are PDB and air, respectively.

   Here we show that cocaine originating from different geographic regions
   in South America can be identified by its isotope-ratio signature. The
   distinct carbon (􀀁13C) and nitrogen (􀀁15N) isotope-ratio combinations
   allow the country of origin to be determined for the principal
   coca-growing regions along the Andean Ridge. By combining this
   information with detectable differences in the patterns of the trace
   alkaloids truxilline and trimethoxycocaine, we correctly identified the
   source of 96% of 200 cocaine samples.

   Cocaine is the most widely used narcotic drug, making the determination
   of the geographic origin of illicit cocaine the focus of intense
   investigation by the forensic community1,2. Previous studies have
   concentrated on detecting the trace residues present in cocaine or the
   trace alkaloids that are extracted with it; these have met with limited
   success, although they have been valuable in identifying the processing
   methods peculiar to different regions. However, refined cocaine base is
   often transported from one country to another for its final conversion
   to cocaine hydrochloride, mak-ing the source harder to identify.

   Stable-isotope ratios (􀀁) have been used as indicators of the
   geographical source of a wide variety of biological and non-biological
   materials, from migrating butterflies3 to emeralds4. The natural
   isotopic variation in organic matter in plants can be applied to
   predict the variation in 􀀁2H, 􀀁13C, 􀀁15N and 􀀁18O values along
   ecological gradients5–8.

   There are large environmental differences in the coca-growing regions
   of South America. We investigated the variation in 􀀁13C and 􀀁15N of
   coca leaves and of the extracted cocaine from plants from different
   countries along the Andean Ridge, collecting 200 coca leaf sets from
   throughout each of the five primary growing regions: the Chapare Valley
   of Bolivia, the Huallaga and Ucayali Valleys and Apurimac Valley of
   Peru, and the Putumayo–Caqueta and Guaviare regions of Colombia (Fig.
   1). Sub-sets of the same coca leaves were then extracted for
   determination of total alka-loids9, and trimethoxycocaine and
   truxilline content10. We purified cocaine base (to over 98% purity)
   from these extracts by column chromatography on alumina and measured
   􀀁13C and 􀀁15N to a precision of greater than 0.1 part per thousand on
   corresponding sets of coca leaves and purified cocaine samples11.

   Over the entire geographical distribu-tion, 􀀁13C and 􀀁15N values for
   coca leaves vary from 􀀂32.4‰ to 􀀂25.3‰ for 􀀁13C, and from 0.1‰ to 13.0‰
   for 􀀁15N. Leaves from the Putumayo and Caqueta regions of Colombia are
   distinguishable from each other by their 􀀁13C content, as are those
   from the Huallaga and Ucayali Valleys from the Apurimac Valley of Peru.
   Coca leaf from Bolivia has consistently less 15N than material from
   Peru. There is more 15N in coca leaves from Colombia and least in coca
   grown in the Chapare Valley of Bolivia.

   To determine the probability that a sample could have originated from
   one of these three countries, we used bivariate mean and standard
   deviation parameters to estimate the frequency with which we could
   correct-ly identify the country of origin of these coca-leaf samples.
   We predicted the country of origin by assigning a sample to the region
   to which it was associated with the highest probability. Using this
   approach, we accurately predicted the country of origin of 90% of the
   200 coca-leaf samples.

   The truxilline and trimethoxycocaine content of coca leaves contributed
   additional information, showing a clear demarcation between the
   Guaviare and Putumayo–Caqueta regions and locations in Peru and Bolivia
   (Table 1). Although it was not possible to differentiate Peruvian and
   Bolivian cocaine from their trace-alkaloid analyses, these samples were
   distinguishable by 􀀁13C and 􀀁15N analysis.

   Combining alkaloid and isotopic-ratio analyses is a powerful means for
   determin-ing the country of origin of cocaine from these different
   regions in South America (Fig. 1). Taking advantage of our observa-tion
   that truxilline content and cocaine 􀀁15N are positively correlated and
   that cocaine 􀀁13C and trimethoxycocaine are negatively correlated, a
   combination plot reveals that the cocaine samples from different
   regions cluster into tighter groups based on their country of origin.
   Using our analytical approach, we were able accurately to predict the
   country of origin of 96% of the 200 cocaine samples.

   The environmental basis for this region-al variation in coca-leaf and
   cocaine stable isotopes may be due to differences in soils affecting
   􀀁15N, and in the humidity and length of the wet season affecting 􀀁13C.
   It has been proposed8 that nutrient cycles in tropical forest
   ecosystems (typical of coca-growing regions) are more open than in
   drier, more temperate regions, and the range of coca-leaf 􀀁15N values
   are consistent with this idea. 􀀁13C differences are narrower, but are
   consistent with patterns predicted by 􀀁13C theory for plants5,6.

   TracingtheGeographicalOriginofCocainechart944x225

   Means and standard deviations of truxilline and trimethoxycocaine
   content of coca leaves, together with the ratio of truxillines to
   trimethoxycocaines growing in different regions of South America are
   shown. Data are given on a w/w% basis using structurally related
   internal standards.

   Tracing the country of origin of cocaine is now feasible through
   automated, routine analysis of both stable isotopes and trace
   alkaloids, opening up strategic options for identifying source regions
   and trafficking routes. We have shown how ecological and
   isotopic-fractionation principles used to predict isotopic-ratio
   patterns associated with plants from different ecosystems can also be
   applied to determine the distribution of an illegal drug, as well as to
   identify new coca-producing regions as they develop. James R.

   Identification of Odor Signature Chemicals in Cocaine Using Solid-Phase
   Microextraction– Gas Chromatography and Detector-Dog Response to
   Isolated Compounds Spiked on U.S. Paper Currency

   Abstract

   Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography
   (GC) is optimized and applied to the analysis of street-cocaine samples
   followed by the field-testing of isolated chemicals using certified
   detector dogs. SPME proves to be a very sensitive and rapid method for
   isolating odor chemicals from street-cocaine samples. SPME–GC and
   activated charcoal strip

   (ACS)–SPME–GC signature profile methods are developed for the detection
   and quantitation of cocaine-odor chemicals, including the optimization
   of controllable variables such as fiber chemistry, extraction time, and
   desorption time. The volatile odor chemicals in representative illicit
   cocaine samples are identified and quantitated by the ACS–SPME–GC
   signature profile method and direct injection. Field tests with drug
   detector dogs show methyl benzoate to be the dominant signature odor
   chemical along with cocaine on U.S. currency at a threshold level of
   approximately 1–10 µg when spiked or when 10 ng/s methyl benzoate is
   diffused from polymer bottles, which is required in order to initiate
   an alert. No other substance studied initiated consistent responses by
   the drug dogs. The results indicate that the microgram levels of
   cocaine that have been reported on circulated U.S. currency are
   insufficient to signal an alert from law-enforcement trained drug
   detector dogs.

   Introduction

   The use of detector dogs in forensic science is widely accepted in the
   forensic science field and legal community, but until recently there
   have been few scientific studies to support their capabilities under
   real-world scenarios. The ability and reliability of detector dogs in
   the area of narcotics detection has recently been in question. The use
   of drug detector dogs alerting to currency associated with drug
   trafficking has become a point of contention because of reports that
   most money in circulation is tainted with trace levels of cocaine
   (1–6). A study of the cocaine contamination of circulated U.S. currency
   demonstrated that cocaine is present on money in general circulation,
   but not in a sufficient enough quantity that it cannot be easily
   removed by any method other than solvent washing (1). Paper currency
   contaminated by counting the money with micrograms of cocaine on the
   fingertips did yield detectable quantities of cocaine by a shaking
   method (1). No drugs other than cocaine have been reported to be widely
   found innocently contaminated on circulated U.S. currency. In one
   study, a trace of diacetylmorphine and tetra-hydrocannabinol was
   reported on two bills out of 21, but no quantitation was performed (2).
   Unfortunately, the limited studies to date have relied on tiny sample
   sizes chaotically sampled from specific sites, which cannot be reliably
   extrapolated to represent the more than $500 billion in U.S. paper
   cur-rency (20 billion bank notes) in circulation at any given time. The
   published studies on the total solvent extractable amount of cocaine
   from circulated U.S. currency have shown an average amount of 14.5 µg
   cocaine per bill from a total of 286 notes tested in four different
   studies (3–6). Also, because the average lifetime of U.S. paper
   currency is less than four years, these studies are currently out of
   date. Studies would have to be carried out on a regular basis taking
   into account the con-stant turnover of paper bills and thus the
   variability of any contamination levels as a function of time.

   Nonetheless, these reports have resulted in contaminated money theories
   purporting that because of this widespread contamination any person
   carrying currency could potentially initiate a drug-dog alert. The
   legal significance of this theory ranges from reducing the probative
   value of drug-dog alerts to the complete elimination of a drug-dog
   alert if indeed drug dogs can alert to any amount of circulated paper
   currency. This contam-inated money theory was relied upon by the 9th
   U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1994, which upheld the dismissal of a
   for-feiture case stating that “… evidence that greater than 75% of all
   circulated money … is contaminated with drug residue distinguishes this
   case from our previous cases” (7). In the case of the United States v.
   $506,231 U.S. Currency (1997), the Seventh Circuit Court held that a
   trained-drug-dog alert to narcotics odor on currency was insufficient
   to establish probable cause for forfeiture based on the assertion that
   at least one-third of the currency in the United States is contaminated
   with cocaine (8). The questions raised are the same for any forensic
   specimen ranging from drugs to explosives, including exactly what
   chemicals are certified detector dogs being trained to alert to and
   what is their sensitivity and specificity. The present results are part
   of a long-term project including laboratory experiments and optimized
   field-testing techniques to identify and quantitate the active odor
   signature chemicals in illicit forensic specimens, which certified
   detector dogs use for detection (9–11).

   The major goals of this work were to confirm the identity and quantity
   of the unique volatile odor chemical (or chemi-cals) of illicit cocaine
   that dogs use to detect cocaine employing solid-phase microextraction
   (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC), including the
   optimization of controllable variables such as fiber chemistry,
   extraction time, and desorption time. Additionally, field tests of the
   identified volatile odor chemicals were performed using spiked samples
   and polymer-based controlled delivery devices with certified
   law-enforce-ment narcotics detector dogs under different field
   conditions. In this work, we apply SPME to the recovery of
   street-cocaine odor signature chemicals confirmed by alerts to
   individual isolated chemicals using detector dogs. SPME has been shown
   to be a valuable technique for the analysis of a variety of forensic
   specimens because of its ability of multiple sampling, preserving the
   sample, minimizing the risk of sample conta-mination, fast analysis
   time, and the fact that it is readily automated (12–15). Also, the
   lower detection limits generally afforded by SPME allow for the
   confirmation of positive samples that previously went undetected. An
   additional benefit of SPME is the elimination of solvents that can save
   forensic science laboratories money and the reduction or elimination of
   the risk of analysts being exposed to toxic substances.

   Figure 1. Comparison of the GC–FID response of cocaine odors extracted
   by various fibers for 12 h.

   The purities of cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride from the
   production of illicit cocaine are typically 80–95% and 80–97%,
   respectively. Pharmaceutical-grade cocaine may con-tain more than 99.5%
   cocaine, but it also has some coca-related impurities (16). The
   quantity and quality of the impurities in illicit cocaine (i.e.,
   benzoic acid, anhydroecgonine methyl ester, anhydroecgonine,
   trans-cinnamic acid, ecgonine methyl ester, ecgonine, pseudoecgonine,
   tropacocaine, benzoylecgonine, nor-cocaine, beta-truxinic acid,
   alpha-truxillic acid, ciscinnamoyl ecgonine methyl ester,
   trans-cinnamoyl ecogonine methyl ester, and N-formylcocaine) are
   different from sample to sample and batch to batch (17). We have also
   found methyl benzoate to be commonly present, which was not analyzed
   for in previous studies (10). Solvent residues are also commonly found
   in illicit cocaine hydrochloride samples during the precipitation
   process (the crystalline cocaine traps solvent molecules into its
   crystal lattice). Some of the common solvents that are found in illicit
   cocaine include methyl ethyl ketone, hexane, toluene, benzene, acetone,
   methylene chloride, xylenes, ethyl ether, cyclohexane, and ethyl
   acetate (18). The chromatographic impurity signature profile analysis
   of cocaine (including relatively high-molecular-weight components) has
   proven to be useful in matching cocaine exhibits assumed to originate
   from the same source or batch (15). Only the volatile odor signature
   chemicals were the focus of this study. The limited olfactory
   psychophysical studies to date have involved either laboratory tests
   with olfactometers in which dogs were trained and then tested using
   sniffer ports or “search-and-find” procedures with dogs trained for
   police work (19). This latter type of test was used in this study.

   Experimental

   Methyl benzoate, propyl benzoate, and methyl trans-cinnamate were
   purchased from Aldrich Chem-ical Co. (Milwaukee, WI). trans-Cinnamic
   acid, tropacocaine, and cocaine base were purchased from Sigma Chemical
   Co. (St. Louis, MO). Ecgonine methyl ester (1000 µg/mL in acetonitrile)
   and anhydroecgonine methyl ester (1000 µg/mL in acetonitrile) were
   purchased from Radian. All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher
   Scientific. Street-cocaine samples were supplied by the Miami-Dade
   Police Department (Miami, FL). Paint cans were obtained from American
   International Containers (Miami, FL). DFLEX active charcoal strips
   (ACSs) were obtained from Albrayco Labs Inc.(Cromwell, CT). A
   Hewlett-Packard (HP)(Wilmington, DE) GC (HP 6890) coupled with a flame
   ionization detector (FID) or mass spectrometer (MS) (5973) and a J&W
   Scientific (Folsom, CA) DB-5MS capillary column (30-m × 0.25-mm i.d.,
   0.25-µm film thickness) were used in the SPME–GC detection. The fiber
   from the sampling process was introduced to the split/splitless
   injection port of the GC, in which the analytes from the fiber were
   thermally desorbed. The temperature of the injection port and the
   detection port were 250°C and 300°C, respectively. For the GC–MS
   exper-iments the transfer line was kept at 280°C. The temperature of
   the oven was programmed at 45°C and held for 1 min, then it was ramped
   at 20°C/min to 160°C and held for 0 min, 2°C/min to 170°C and held for
   0 min, and 15°C/min to 250°C and held for 3 min. A purge delay time for
   venting was set for 2 min. The flow rate of the car-rier gas (helium)
   was 1 mL/min.

   SPME fibers with different polymeric coatings including
   Carboxen–poly-(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) (75 µm), poly (ethylene
   glycol)–poly(divinylbenzene) (Carbowax–DVB) (65 µm), poly(acrylate)
   (PA)(85 µm), PDMS (7 µm), PA (85 µm) fibers, and an SPME holder were
   purchased from Supelco Inc. (Bellefonte, PA). Each fiber was
   preconditioned in the GC injection port prior to use according to the
   manufacturer’s recommendations (250–320°C for 0.5–2 h). For the
   cocaine-odor sampling, each SPME fiber was set up to extract the
   headspace of mixtures of cocaine odors prepared from working solutions
   at room temperature for 12 h. They were then transferred to the GC
   injection port for thermal desorption for successive 1-min desorptions.
   The Carbowax–DVB fiber was used to extract the headspace above the
   cocaine-odor standard mixture (i.e., the working solution) at different
   extraction times: 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 12, 16, and 24.5 h. GC–FID analysis
   was carried out immediately after each extraction.

   a function of time.

   For the street cocaine sampling, a 200-ppm propyl benzoate solution was
   used as the internal standard. A charcoal strip together with its metal
   support and protective Teflon membrane was placed into a quart paint
   can followed by 1 g of street cocaine contained in a 4-mL glass vial
   uncapped into the same can. The can was then sealed tightly with a
   hammer. After 24 h, the can was opened and the charcoal taken out. The
   ACS was transferred into a 15-mL sample glass vial after the outer
   protective Teflon membrane was cut off. Four milliliters of the
   internal standard solution in acetonitrile was added in order to
   extract the analytes absorbed on the charcoal strip out into the
   sol-vent. Five-hundred microliters of this extract was pipetted into a
   2-mL GC autosampler vial. The Carbowax–DVB was set up to extract the
   headspace of the acetonitrile extract for 1.5 h. The fiber was then
   thermally desorbed in the GC injection port for 1 min. Perfume analysis
   was performed by headspace SPME–GC–MS sampling for 5 min fol-lowed by a
   1-min desorption into the injection port at 250°C.

   For the detector-dog tests, precleaned and oven-dried 9-inch round
   galvanized steel boxes with six small holes on the top containing
   one-dollar denominations of U.S. currency were placed in test areas
   with carefully monitored humidity and temperature. Solutions containing
   dif-ferent amounts of cocaine and byproducts were prepared in
   chloroform solutions and delivered to the currency at least 20 min
   before testing. This time allowed the chloroform to completely
   evaporate without significantly reducing the amount of odor chemicals
   present. The U.S. paper currency was spiked with successively
   increasing amounts of
   IdentificationofOdorSignatureChemicalsinCocainefullPage4500x584
   pharmaceutical-grade cocaine, street cocaine, and volatile cocaine
   byproducts, including methyl benzoate, benzoic acid, ecgonine, ecgonine
   methyl ester, trans-cinnamic acid, methyl trans-cinnamate,
   benzaldehyde, and ethylbenzoate. What we refer to as
   pharmaceutical-grade cocaine was actually highly purified cocaine from
   Sigma. In addition, ten different 400- to 650-µL capacity
   microcentrifuge tubes were tested as controlled delivery devices for
   the odor chemical methyl benzoate.

   Two tubes with delivery rates (studied over a 5-mo period) of 21 ng/s
   (Fisher snap-cap polyethylene tubes, 0.4 mL) and 1.5 ng/s (Corning
   polypropylene tubes, 0.5 mL) were chosen for testing. In order to
   eliminate possible cross-contamination, the negative control boxes were
   delivered to the test field by different scientists than those who
   handled the spiked containers. The boxes were handled with precleaned
   metal tongs. The dog handlers did not know the contents of the
   containers and were simply instructed to have their dogs sweep the test
   field for controlled substances and identify which containers contained
   the odor of controlled substances as indicated by their detector dog’s
   response. Each different detector dog team was given an identifying
   number, which is included in the tables summarizing the results.
   Temperature, humidity, and time were monitored over the whole test
   period.

   Results and Discussion

   A comparison of GC–FID responses of the cocaine-odors mixture extracted
   by Carboxen–PDMS, Carbowax–DVB, PA, and PDMS at room temperature for 12
   h is shown in Figure 1. Higher molecular-weight standards including
   tropacocaine and cocaine were not extracted by headspace SPME with the
   fibers tested. As a general guideline, the chemical nature of a target
   analyte determines the type of coatings used. As expected, the PDMS
   fiber showed the lowest response because it is a nonpolar phase and
   thus has a lower retention of polar compounds such as the cocaine-odor
   chemicals mentioned. The PA phase however is suitable for more-polar
   compounds. As can be seen, its responses dramatically increased
   compared with that for the PDMS fiber. The Carboxen–PDMS proved to be
   an optimal adsorption fiber chemistry for methyl benzoate; however, it
   took significantly longer time for methyl benzoate to be released from
   Carboxen–PDMS than all the other three fibers (as seen in Figure 2).
   Although methyl benzoate was released completely from the other three
   fibers within 1 min at 250°C, approxi-mately 15% was still trapped on
   the Carboxen–PDMS even after a fourth 1-min desorption. Similarly, it
   took multiple 1-min desorptions for the other analytes and fibers,
   including PA and Carboxen–PDMS requiring more than 4 min to completely
   desorbed benzoic acid (as shown in Figure 2). Overall, of all the
   fibers tested, Car-bowax–DVB was chosen for further study because it
   extracted all of the cocaine odors efficiently (with high sensitivity)
   and released them quickly (within 1 min), minimizing possible carryover
   problems. Subsequently, newer blended fibers (including Carboxen–DVB)
   have great potential as long as sufficient desorption and
   fiber-conditioning times are employed.

   The headspace SPME extraction of the cocaine-odor chemicals as a
   function of time at room temperature using the Carbowax–DVB fiber is
   shown in Figure 3.

   The acidic components benzoic acid and trans-cinnamic acid reached
   maximum recovery within an hour, while others including anhydroecgonine
   methyl ester continued to increase up to the maximum time studied (24
   h) and yet others (including methyl benzoate and methyl
   trans-cinnamate) reached a maximum in 12–14 h and then decreased
   presum-ably because of the displacement effect reported previously
   (15). Street-cocaine samples were analyzed by the two-step extraction
   method using passive headspace concentration with ACSs followed by
   acetonitrile elution and headspace SPME–GC analysis extracted by
   Carbowax–DVB. This method allows for the sensitive, inexpensive, and
   convenient analysis of drug odor chemicals from case samples and
   detector-dog training aids. The GC–FID chromatograms of two
   representative street-cocaine extractions are demonstrated in Figure 4
   with the propyl benzoate internal standard peak seen at 7.5 min. Methyl
   benzoate and trans-cinnamic acid were extracted from all of the samples
   tested, and benzoic acid was detected in one of four tested samples.

   For studying the linearity of the method, the extraction time was
   controlled at 1.5 h because this was the shortest time available to
   extract all the compounds from the mixture. An equal amount of propyl
   benzoate was spiked in each solution as the internal standard, and the
   calibration curves were drawn by plotting the average peak ratio of
   each individual compound over the internal standard against the
   concentration of that compound. The method was linear for most analytes
   studied within the concentration range of 10 to 200 ppm. The acidic
   components benzoic acid and trans-cinnamic acid demonstrated the
   poorest linearity. Triplicate extractions carried out for each
   concentration level for methyl benzoate using the Carbowax–DVB fiber is
   shown in Figure 5 with excellent linearity over the entire range
   studied. The precision of replicate samplings was generally within 5%
   of the relative standard deviation (RSD). The relative concentrations
   of cocaine-odor chemicals for the samples studied are shown in Table I
   using the direct injection of acetonitrile extracts. In general, the
   cocaine-odor concentrations varied widely with methyl benzoate from
   0.010% to 0.036% (w/w) or 31 to 59 ppm using 90-min headspace SPME
   extractions. These values are approximately two orders of magnitude
   higher than that observed for pharmaceutical-grade cocaine with methyl
   benzoate ranging from 0.00010% to 0.000069% as seen in Table II. We
   have also found that methyl benzoate readily forms in cocaine
   formulations over a period of time when exposed to methylating solvents
   such as methanol, but does not form to any appreciable extent in
   pharmaceutical-grade cocaine or chloroform (the solvent used to prepare
   solutions in this study) (as seen in Table II).

   Table III summarizes indoor tests for eight different detector dogs
   using a typical indoor test area shown in Figure 6. The only chemical
   tested, which elicited a consistent response, was methyl benzoate at a
   level of 1 to 10 µg. The presence of cocaine hydrochloride or cocaine
   base does not appear to influence the threshold seen. In fact, testing
   with 1 g of cocaine hydrochloride and 1 g of cocaine base (Sigma) did
   not elicit responses from most of the dogs tested presumably because of
   the very low levels of methyl benzoate (from Table II). Table IV
   summarizes outdoor field tests for 14 different detector dogs (some
   more than once) using a typical outdoor test (shown in Figure 7).
   Again, the only chemical tested that elicited a consistent response was
   methyl benzoate at a consistent level of 10 µg. In addition, Sigma
   Pseudo cocaine (which was confirmed to contain primarily methyl
   benzoate using SPME) and a polymer bottle delivering methyl benzoate at
   a rate of 21 ng/s elicited consistent responses from the detector dogs
   tested. Interestingly, 1 g of a 15-year-old street cocaine sample was
   confirmed to elicit responses from the majority of the detector dogs,
   and 1 g of the pharmaceutical-grade cocaine hydrochloride did not (as
   seen previously).

   Figure 6. Layout of a typical test room with metal boxes containing an
   unknown chemical (or chemicals).

   Figure 8 summarizes the averages of 245 measurements for indoor field
   tests spiking 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 µg of methyl benzoate in the
   presence of 0.1 mg of cocaine HCl or cocaine base (10) and demonstrates
   the sigmoid curve characteristic of biological dose-response curves.
   Because the special sense of smell is a ligand-receptor mediated
   biologic process (20), the law of mass action should apply and a
   dose-response relationship should exist (21). One method used to
   quantitate a drug dose-response relationship is to plot the logarithm
   of the drug concentration against the biologic response (21). In this
   case the concentration of methyl benzoate is plotted against the
   behavioral response of a drug dog (i.e., the dog alerting). The data
   graphed demonstrate the results of experiments designed to determine
   the threshold of the detection of methyl benzoate. The results suggest
   that a dose-response relationship exists between methyl benzoate and
   drug dogs tested for alerting and that the effective dose for 50% of
   the animals tested is approximately 1 µg of methyl benzoate. These
   results have been corroborated with additional field tests using
   dif-ferent numbers, types, and arrangements of delivery devices.
   Overall, more than 120 field tests have been performed in a similar
   manner testing more than 28 different detector dogs from 10 different
   local, state, and federal agencies. The conclusions from this study
   support the U.S. Patent “Available Odor of Cocaine”, which is described
   as “a method and product for providing the aroma of cocaine to the
   olfactory senses by volatilizing methyl benzoate … whereby the aroma of
   street cocaine is perceived” (22).

   The finding that methyl benzoate, rather than the cocaine itself, is
   responsible for alerting drug detector dogs is not surprising based on
   our current knowledge of how detection dogs alert to forensic
   specimens. When a dog is trained to alert to an item (such as a human
   body, explosives, munitions, accelerants, drugs, and currency), the dog
   is often being trained to alert to a scent associated with the item
   rather than the item itself. That scent is commonly composed of
   volatile compounds or classes of compounds, which are detected by the
   dog. If, indeed, drug detector dogs use one dominant chemical to find
   the controlled substance cocaine, one natural question is are there
   noncon-trolled substances that have similar odor signatures. We have
   tested numerous potential interfering substances and to date have only
   found that some fragrances contain methyl benzoate (and only in
   relatively small amounts). Figure 9 shows the SPME–GC–MS analysis of
   one of 10 perfume samples found to contain 3% methyl benzoate (relative
   to the other volatile components). Although such an item has a minority
   component in common with street cocaine in which it is a majority
   compo-nent; overall, the odors are quite different and the limited
   field tests included in Table IV show that certified detector dogs can
   readily distinguish these odors.

   Overall, this study demonstrates that SPME is a powerful method for
   studying drug odor chemicals, and the results con-firm that drug
   detector dogs alert to the common volatile cocaine byproduct methyl
   benzoate rather than to the cocaine itself. None of the dogs tested
   alerted to byproducts other than methyl benzoate, and the majority did
   not alert to pharmaceutical-grade cocaine even at the highest levels
   tested of 1 g. Because this level is some 100,000 times greater than
   that reported on circulated currency, it is not plausible that
   innocently contaminated U.S. currency contains sufficient enough
   quantities of cocaine and associated volatile chemicals to signal an
   alert from a properly trained drug detector dog.

   Isotopic Fractionation of Carbon and Nitrogen During the Illicit
   Processing of Cocaine and Heroin in South America

   IsotopicFractionationofCarbonandNitrogenDuringtheIllicitProcessingofCoc
   aineandHeroininSouthAmericaPage3920x175

   ABSTRACT: The forensic application of stable isotope analysis to
   cocaine and heroin for geolocation of exhibits must take into account
   the possible enrichment and/or depletion of 13Cand 15N during the
   illicit manufacturing process. Continuous-ﬂow elemental
   analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry was utilized to measure
   changes in the stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen for both
   cocaine (N = 92) and heroin/morphine (N = 81) exhibits derived from
   illicit manufacturing processes utilized by South American clandestine
   chemists. In controlled settings in South America, there was no
   siginﬁciant carbon isotope fractionation during the conversion of
   cocaine base to cocaine HCl using current illict methodologies. In
   contrast, nitrogen isotope fractionation for this conversion was 1‰.
   There was a kinetic carbon isotope ratio fractionation during the
   acetylation of Colombian morphine to heroin and as a result heroin
   exhibits will almost always have more negative δ13C values than the
   original morphine. There was an isotopic fractionation against 15N
   during the acetylation of morphine base to heroin base, but this effect
   was not expressed since all of the heroin base was precipitated during
   the manufacturing process. However, the clandestine process of
   converting a single batch of heroin base usually involved two
   consecutive crops of heroin HCl and the latter crop was isotopically
   depleted as expected from a Rayleigh distillation process. When heroin
   was deacetylated to morphine, the morphine produced resulted in δ13C
   values that were indistinguishable from the original morphine. The
   kinetic carbon isotope fractionation factor for the South American
   process of morphine acetylation was −1.8‰, allowing calculation of the
   δ13C values of the acetic anhydride from deacetylated heroin
   δ13Cvalues.

   KEYWORDS: forensic science, stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry,
   kinetic fractionation, Rayleigh fractionation, cocaine, heroin

   The use of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) for licit (1,2) and
   illicit (3–14) drug origin determinations (geosourcing) has in-creased
   in popularity for those laboratories equipped to do so. Much of the
   published work encompasses similar batch comparisons, rather than true
   geosourcing, due to the lack of sufﬁcient authen-tic exhibits. To date,
   only one such stable isotope article on illicit drugs has examined
   adequate authentic exhibits of absolute known geolocation (latitude and
   longitude) (4). The utilization of stable isotopes of carbon and
   nitrogen in drug exhibits is made possi-ble since those atoms become
   ﬁxed in either the natural (cocaine or morphine), semi-synthetic
   (heroin or methamphetamine), or the total synthetic
   (methylenedioxymethamphetamine or metham-phetamine) product. Cocaine
   and morphine are natural products derived from the coca and poppy
   plants, respectively. Heroin is a semi-synthetic drug produced from
   acetylation of the natural product, morphine. Examples of illicit
   drugs, which can be ob-tained from total synthesis, are
   methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), phencyclidine (PCP), and
   methamphetamine.

   Few environmental and biosynthetic fractionation mechanisms are known
   for cocaine and morphine/heroin (4,5). Incorporation of light or heavy
   isotopes can follow several pathways in biolog-ical systems, which can
   include cellulose production and alkaloid biosynthesis. Both the coca
   plant and opium poppy are known to be C3 plants; their leaf δ13C values
   are expected to fall in the absolute range of −33‰ to −23‰ (15). The
   δ13C values for their alkaloidsalso fall within this range, although
   they typically tend to be iso-topically lighter. The δ15N values for
   the plants and their natural alkaloids are dependant on both the soil
   conditions and biosynthetic mechanisms (16–18), with book values
   ranging between −4‰ and+11‰ for all plants. Known 15N values for
   cocaine and heroin typically range between +3‰ to −16‰.

   The isotope ratio (δ15Nand δ13C) values for both illicit cocaine and
   heroin exhibits are altered by fractionation events during clean up and
   puriﬁcation. It should be emphasized that these events are a change in
   the average isotopic composition in the collection of molecules that
   constitute the exhibit, and not changes in the atoms of individual
   molecules. Since illicit cocaine and heroin are not pure compounds but
   instead mixtures, to some degree the changes in exhibit isotope ratio
   reﬂect lesser amounts of other natural products as the materials are
   puriﬁed. Little attention has been paid to the potential isotopic
   fractionations in going from raw plant materials to these ﬁnished
   alkaloid products. In the course of our work with cocaine and heroin,
   we have noticed isotopic differences in the free base and HCl ion-pair
   forms of these drugs which require explanation if isotope ratio
   analyses are to be used as a forensic tool.

   There are two types of isotopic fractionation to be considered: 1)
   phase change or equilibrium fractionation and 2) kinetic fraction-ation
   (19). An example of introducing a phase change fractionation would be
   manipulation of the salt form for the drug and is usually dependant on
   the equilibrium of the system. This can include a Rayleigh
   fractionation, in which the isotope ratio of the ﬁnished product is a
   function of the fraction precipitated from solution. A kinetic
   fractionation event would be introduced by a reaction, which would
   either involve atomic exchange or manipulation (addition or deletion of
   atomic species).

   Results and Discussion

   Cocaine

   Each of the clandestine cocaine chemists was provided multi-ple
   kilograms of cocaine base to process into cocaine HCl. Each chemist
   utilized one kilogram of base per batch of cocaine HCl produced. Three
   of the Colombian chemists (Chemists 1–3) were allowed to utilize a
   non-typical procedure that is currently obsolete. The non-typical
   procedure precipitated approximately 800 grams of cocaine HCl by adding
   200 mL of concentrated HCl to the process. The remaining unprecipitated
   cocaine base was extracted from the solutions and would usually be sold
   as bazooka, for smoking purposes. The typical procedure utilized 275 mL
   of concentrated HCl to produce one kilogram of cocaine HCl. The
   remaining Colombian, Peruvian, and Bolivian chemists all produced
   one-kilogram batches of cocaine HCl.

   Results from isotopic analyses of the cocaine exhibits associated with
   the conversion of cocaine base to cocaine HCl are illustrated in Table
   1. There were minimal changes in the δ13C values of co-caine in the
   clandestine processing, independent of the conversion method utilized.
   In fact, when all 46 individual batches of cocaine are examined for
   δ13C, the difference between the base and HCl forms averaged less than
   0.1‰. This is not surprising since all of the carbons on the cocaine
   molecule are essentially non-reactive and are not exchanged during the
   base-to-HCl process. Even if one of the cocaine carbons was somewhat
   susceptible to inﬂuence by equilibrium exchange effects, sixteen other
   carbons in the molecule would retain their isotopic integrity and
   physical properties, thus minimizing a phase change or equilibrium
   fractionation. The measured δ13Cvalues(‰) for cocaine are essentially a
   “mass average” of all carbons throughout the cocaine molecule.

   An apparent fractionation against 15N in cocaine occurred during the
   clandestine base-to-HCl conversion and this is reﬂected in the
   differences in δ15N values of the base and HCl forms of cocaine (Table
   1). The nitrogen atom is reactive in this case, as is illustrated in
   Fig. 1. This apparent fractionation is expected, since the lone pair of
   electrons on the nitrogen are involved in acquiring the ion-pair of
   hydrochloric acid. The Colombian chemists (1–3) that produced only 800
   grams of cocaine HCl obtained the greatest 15N enrichment in their
   processing, with average 15N enrichment values ranging from 2.2‰ to
   3.7‰. This equilibrium exchange fractionation apparently exhibits a
   Rayleigh fractionation in which the isotope ratio of the product is
   dependent on what fraction of the cocaine has been precipitated.
   Isotopic mass balance is maintained because the unprecipitated cocaine
   is 15N depleted. Although we were not able to measure the isotopic
   ratios of the unprecipitated cocaines, their δ15Nvalues(‰), due to mass
   balance, would have to be more negative than the precipitated products.

   To examine this possibility further, we conducted an experiment in
   which successive fractions of cocaine were precipitated from solution.
   Data from this experiment in Table 2 illustrate that the fractionation
   of nitrogen is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than that
   for carbon. Figure 2 shows a plot of the isotope ratios of the
   precipitated cocaine as a function of the total fraction that has been
   precipitated. These data verify a Rayleigh fractiona-tion. The
   remaining clandestine chemists obtained one kilogram of product,
   regardless of illicit methodology, all having similar fractionations of
   15N. These exhibits were also 15N enriched, but to a lesser extent,
   with values ranging from 0.7‰ to 1.1‰.There-sults also follow the
   Rayleigh fractionation curve. Although these chemists obtained 1 kg of
   product from one kilogram of cocaine base, it was approximately an 88%
   actual yield. The 15N enrichment equilibrium is therefore not as
   prominent for the higher yielding chemists due to this effect. In
   theory, if a clandestine chemist had ob-tained 100% of the theoretical
   yield, there would be no measurable fractionation of nitrogen or
   carbon. Based on the experimental results, it appears that cocaine
   containing 15N has a slightly greater afﬁnity to form the HCl ion-pair
   and precipitate from solution than its 14N species. Overall, the
   average fractionation of 15N was found to be 1.0‰ for typical (current)
   processing methodologies through-out South America for the conversion
   of cocaine base into cocaine HCl.

   Conclusions

   There is minimal carbon isotope fractionation in illicit co-caine
   processing (base-to-HCl) and values were not affected by different
   processing methodologies. Fractionation of 15N in illicit cocaine
   processing was detectable when not all of the cocaine was precipitated.
   An average 􀀁δ15N value of 1.0‰ was determined for conversion of cocaine
   base to cocaine HCl using current illicit methodologies.

   The isotopic fractionation against 15N during the acetylation of
   morphine base to “major crops” of heroin base was minimal. How-ever,
   considerable fractionation against 15N was detectable in the residual
   minor crops of heroin base. A kinetic fractionation event was observed
   for the Colombian method of acetylation of morphine. Due to this
   effect, heroin exhibits will almost always have more negative δ13C
   values than the original morphine. Fraction-ation against 15N was
   signiﬁcant during the clandestine process of converting heroin base to
   heroin HCl, especially for chemists that produced two major crops of
   heroin HCl. The Colombian pro-cess for producing heroin can
   signiﬁcantly alter the natural isotopic abundances of nitrogen.
   However, when heroin is deacetylated to morphine, the produced morphine
   gives virtually identical δ13C values to the original morphine.
   Furthermore, we can now calcu-late the approximate δ13C values for the
   acetic anhydride which was utilized for the morphine acetylation.

   Measurements were made on the natural abundance 14C content (D14C) of
   cocaine specimens seized between 2003 and 2009. The objective of this
   study was to determine the extent to which D14C analyses could quantify
   the ‘‘age’’ of recent cocaine seizures. Here ‘‘age’’ of a seized
   cocaine specimen is deﬁned as the time period between when a coca leaf
   was harvested in South America and its seizure as cocaine at either the
   international or domestic street levels. Based on D14C analyses of
   seizure specimens, there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences
   in the ages of domestic cocaine HCl and cocaine base specimens seized
   on the streets in different locations across the United States. Between
   2007 and 2009, the average age of a street-level cocaine seizure in the
   United States was 24.6 +- 1.1 months. Cocaine shipment seizures that
   were in excess of 150 kg during this time period had an average age of
   18.2 +- 1.4 months, whereas smaller shipment seizures were signiﬁcantly
   older with an average age of 22.3 +- 0.6 months. Analyses of the
   largest cocaine shipment seizures suggested that these seizures were
   composed of specimens with different ages, possibly representing
   accumulations over as much as a 31-month period.

   1. Introduction

   Cocaine is a widely distributed and highly addictive stimulant, and is
   categorized in the United States as a Schedule II drug under the
   Controlled Substances Act of 1970. During the 5-year period 2005–2009,
   the amount of cocaine seized in the U.S. averaged 76,802 kg [1].
   Cocaine is easily obtained on the street in U.S. cities and represents
   a chronic burden to both health care and law enforcement systems. Over
   the past two decades the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s Cocaine
   Signature Program (CSP) at its Special Testing Research Laboratory
   (DEA-STRL) has developed a number of chemical characterization
   approaches to trace the geographical origins of cocaine [2–7],
   including stable isotope and chromatographic approaches. However, in
   contrast to region-of-origin information, little is known from a
   scientiﬁc viewpoint about the age of a cocaine specimen sold on the
   streets today.

   There are no quantitative data on the time lag between coca production
   and street sales of cocaine. Thus, for years there has been a
   disconnect between estimates of cocaine production, ﬂow, and
   consumption, leading U.S. intelligence analysts and policy-makers to
   assume one or more of the estimates were invalid, or that strategic
   stockpiles in South America, Mexico, or elsewhere allowed trafﬁckers to
   manipulate cocaine ﬂow regardless of current production. One of the key
   pieces connecting production, ﬂow, and consumption – the time lag
   between production and the retail market – has never been fully
   understood. Analysts previously assumed a 6–12 month lag, but little
   reporting existed to support that estimate. Without these data,
   questions regarding strategic stockpiling and supply reduction effects
   have been difﬁcult to quantify with conﬁdence.

   The 14C content at natural abundance levels has been applied as a
   quantitative technique to determine the age of modern biological
   materials (post 1962), because of the atmospheric 14C ‘bomb spike’
   associated with extensive aboveground nuclear testing in advance of the
   1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty [8,9]. The 14C measurement of modern
   biological samples has allowed quantitative determination of age for a
   number of forensic applications [10], including human age
   determinations through analyses of teeth [11,12], the ages of human
   skeletal remains [13–15], opium and wine year of production [16], and
   the year that an individual died based on hair analyses [17,18].

   Determination of D14C values of cocaine specimens could be used to
   examine the time lag between coca leaf harvest in the ﬁeld and when a
   seized cocaine specimen in transit or on the streets of the United
   States. Prior to this study, analysts could not demonstrate that an
   apparent decline in cocaine supply within South America had a
   measurable strategic impact on cocaine availability in the United
   States. In this regard, the average time it takes for cocaine to make
   the journey from a coca leaf harvested to street-level consumption in
   the United States is not well understood. However, all available
   information clearly indicated that not all the cocaine produced in a
   year was actually consumed in that same year. Some analysts have
   suggested that trafﬁckers may maintain strategic stockpiles of cocaine
   to compensate for ﬂuctuations in the supply. Although an attractive
   theory, the intelligence and drug law enforcement communities have no
   hard information to either prove or disprove the strategic stockpile
   theory.

   The objective of this study was to determine lag times between harvest
   of coca leaves in the ﬁeld and the seizure of cocaine within the United
   States. Although the year-to-year changes in atmospheric 14C are
   continuously decreasing [8,9], which reduces the time resolution
   capacity of the modern 14C measurement, with careful calibration we
   hypothesized that sufﬁcient time resolution was still possible to
   provide quantitative estimates of the ages of cocaine specimens seized
   on the streets of the United States.

   2. Materials and methods

   2.1. Cocaine specimen acquisition

   D14C results are reported for 539 cocaine specimens, obtained through
   the DEA-STRL. We analyzed 423 cocaine HCl and 116 cocaine base
   specimens. Most cocaine HCl or cocaine base specimens were ‘‘street
   seizures.’’ Others were described as bulk seizures (threshold of >10
   kg). The 423 cocaine-HCl specimens represented 307 seizures. Each of
   the 116 cocaine base specimens analyzed represented a different
   seizure. Seizure dates for cocaine specimens in this study ranged
   between October 2003 and June 2009, spanning a D14C range of 119% to
   38%, respectively. The Supplementary Material File associated with this
   publication provides a description of each specimen and its D14C value
   (%).

   Of the cocaine specimens analyzed, 455 were seized in the continental
   United States and 12 in U.S. territories, representing 368 and 7
   seizures, respectively. An additional 72 specimens were seized outside
   the United States, representing 48 seizures as described: Australia (n
   = 1), Bolivia (n = 11), Brazil (n = 1), Colombia (n = 2), the Eastern
   Paciﬁc (n = 3), Ecuador (n = 3), Israel (n = 1), Italy (n = 18), Mexico
   (n = 1), Peru (n = 3) and Thailand (n = 4).

   2.2. 14C analyses and reference materials

   Determination of D14C contents in cocaine specimens were made on
   graphite targets produced from CO2 that resulted from the combustion of
   the cocaine specimen [19]. Measurements were made on the accelerator
   mass spectrometer (AMS) at the UC Irvine Keck Carbon Cycle AMS
   Laboratory (http://www.ess.uci.edu/ams/).

   All 14C observations are presented as D14C (%) values with units of %
   or per mil deviation from the 1950 standard [8,19]: where x is the
   measurement year (2009). See also Supplementary Material File.

   A series of internal reference materials commonly used in AMS allowed
   us to independently determine the precision of the analyses and
   therefore the age resolution of the technique. These reference
   materials included standards commonly used at the Keck Lab: acetanilide
   (for use as a blank), oxalic acid (OX2) for data correction, and
   ANU-sucrose and cellulose (IAEA-C3) as secondary standards. A second
   oxalic acid reference material (IAEA-C7) was analyzed in several
   analytical runs (wheels) as an additional quality control measure.
   Observed variations in the reference material results over the course
   of our observations are summarized in Table 1. The results show that
   the radiocarbon dating can resolve differences among any individual
   specimen that are 􀀆4.3% in D14C. In this study, interpretations will be
   based on the most conservative of the reference material precision
   estimates: IAEA-C3. We therefore calculated radiocarbon analytical
   precision using the reference material, IAEA-C3, a secondary standard,
   that was analyzed in every wheel (analytical run) with the cocaine
   specimens. The mean value for IAEA-C3 was D14C = 288.5 􀀁 4.3% (n = 24).
   Therefore, in subsequent interpretations we do not statistically
   distinguish among individual recent single-value D14C observations that
   are less than 4.3% different from another. In absolute time, this
   translated to 􀀃12 months between 2 coca specimens that were grown in
   2009. However, for analyses of multiple specimens within a single
   seizure, the calculated average age differences could be less than 12
   months depending on the standard deviation of the seizure population
   under consideration.

   2.3. Conversion of 14C observations into dates and time lag estimates

   Calibration of the absolute date of production of modern coca leaf or
   cocaine specimens was conducted in a separate study [20], in which coca
   leaves were harvested at speciﬁc dates in Colombia over a 10-year
   period. In that study, cocaine was also extracted from coca leaves,
   allowing for determination of the D14C versus year-of-production
   relationship of both modern coca leaf and cocaine specimens. The
   D14C-based calibration curve that allowed calculation of the date of
   growth determination was where Tc is the absolute date in years that a
   coca specimen was harvested in the ﬁeld in Colombia, D14Cc is the D14C
   value of cocaine extracted from that coca leaf, d = 2.422 􀀄 1045, and f
   = 􀀂0.050072 [20]. The exponential regression explained 97% of the
   observation variation.

   To calculate the age of a seized cocaine specimen (Asc) in months, we
   calculated the difference between Tc and the date in years that a
   specimen was seized (Tsc) as where j is the ratio the number of months
   (12) to days (365.25) in a year.

   2.4. Statistical analyses

   The cocaine D14C data were analyzed graphically and statistically using
   Excel (Microsoft, Seattle, WA), KaleidaGraph (Reading, PA), and InStat
   (La Jolla, CA) software programs. Specimens with multiple D14C
   measurements are reported as the mean value. Unless otherwise noted,
   the Mann–Whitney Test was used for all statistics where p-values are
   reported. Statistical analyses of cocaine specimens were conducted on
   the calculated ‘‘age in months’’ (Asc). For all statistical analyses,
   statistical signiﬁcance is deﬁned as a < 0.05.

   Multi-specimen seizures are deﬁned as cocaine seizures in which more
   than one specimen was acquired from the seizure. A total of 59 seizures
   fell into this category; the range was 2–18 (mean = 3.1) specimens per
   seizure. Multi-specimen seizures have the potential to bias
   interpretations within the dataset by over-representation when compared
   with single-specimen seizures. To avoid the potential for bias, a mean
   seizure age was calculated for each of the 59 major seizures. In that
   way, it was possible to compare seizures with multiple specimens with
   seizures having only a single specimen. Statistical results are
   presented using this mean value unless otherwise noted.

   3. Results

   On average for all specimens, there was a 22.8 􀀁 1.4 month lag

   (Asc) between when cocaine was biosynthetically produced in coca leaves
   (as coca leaf growth based on [20]) and subsequently seized on a
   particular date (Fig. 2). The individual dates were calculated based on
   the difference between the expected D14C value of a cocaine specimen on
   the date the specimen was seized versus the observed D14C. The
   regression line in Fig. 1 represents D14C versus T, the relationship
   between D14C measured on authentic specimens collected in the ﬁeld
   versus dates of those collections [20]. Cocaine seizures plot above the
   line, with varying Asc values that could be associated with cocaine
   extraction process, packaging, transportation, and storage factors. The
   Data were ﬁrst analyzed by assigning all of the seized cocaine
   specimens into one of two categories: cocaine HCl and cocaine base. We
   then compared the ages of cocaine specimens classiﬁed into one of these
   two groups. There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in mean
   ages of cocaine HCl (mean = 22.4 months) versus cocaine base (mean =
   24.1 months) (p = 0.2484, U0 = 19,102). The signiﬁcance of these
   observations is not clear with the limited data available, but it is
   perhaps surprising that seized cocaine base and HCl specimens did not
   differ in age.

   Cocaine specimens were then analyzed with respect to by
   region-of-seizure. When foreign-seized cocaine base and cocaine HCl
   were compared, there was no statistically signiﬁcant differ-ence in
   mean ages of cocaine HCl (mean = 21.2 months) versus cocaine base (mean
   = 25.6 months) (p = 0.5303, U0 = 129.50). We then considered
   comparisons based on domestic U.S. versus foreign seizure locations. We
   examined the dataset to determine whether there were age-based
   differences between foreign and domestically seized cocaine (lumping
   base and HCl specimens since these two populations were not different).
   When the two populations were compared, there was no statistically
   signiﬁcant difference in mean ages of domestic (mean = 22.6 months) and
   foreign-seizure populations (mean = 24.7 months) of combined cocaine
   HCl and cocaine base populations (p = 0.2625, U0 = 9710.5). When
   foreign specimens, seized only in South and Central America (mean =
   25.7 months), were compared with all other foreign seizures (mean =
   23.9 months) they were not statistically different in age (p = 0.6253,
   U0 = 307.50). Again, the signiﬁcance of these observations is not clear
   with the limited data available, but it is perhaps surprising.

   When Asc values of the domestic population of cocaine HCl (mean = 22.0
   months) and foreign population of cocaine HCl (mean = 25.1 months) were
   compared, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in mean ages
   (p = 0.1374, U0 = 6332.5). When the domestic population of cocaine base
   (mean = 24.0 months) and foreign population of cocaine base (mean =
   21.2 months) were compared, there was no statistically signiﬁcant
   difference in mean ages (p = 0.7421, U0 = 299.50).

   There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in mean ages of
   domestic U.S. seizures (mean = 22.6 months) and U.S. Territory (mean =
   24.4 months) cocaine seizure populations for base and HCl combined (p =
   0.8465, U0 = 1343.5).

   When the domestic (mean = 22.0 months) and U.S. Territory (mean = 20.3
   months) populations of cocaine HCl were compared, there was no
   statistically signiﬁcant difference in mean ages (p = 0.4172, U0 =
   924.50). There were too few values to make comparisons between domestic
   cocaine base and U.S. Territory-seized cocaine base.

   Collectively, these results indicated that Asc values for cocaine base
   and cocaine HCl specimens, could be lumped in further age-related
   analyses since none of the populations were statistically different.

   There were no U.S. region-speciﬁc differences in the ages of seized
   cocaine specimens. To determine whether there were age-based
   differences in cocaine by domestic region, each domestic cocaine base
   and hydrochloride specimen was assigned to one of seven speciﬁc
   regions: Central (median age = 19.9 months), East (median age = 22.0
   months), Midwest (median age = 26.9 -months), South (median age = 21.0
   months), Southwest (median age = 22.1 months), West (median age = 22.7
   months), and U.S. Territory (median age = 19.5 months). A
   Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) detected no
   signiﬁcant differences in the calculated age-in-month median values
   between regions (p = 0.7005, Kruskal–Wallis statistic = 3.824), likely
   because of limited sample sizes in the statistical analyses.

   Cocaine specimens were classiﬁed as ‘‘CSP,’’ part of the Cocaine
   Signature Program at the DEA-STRL, or as ‘‘street’’ seizures, not
   related to the CSP. Whereas CSP specimens were of a large size >10 kg,
   street-seizure specimens were <28 g. CSP seizures consisted of foreign
   and domestic cocaine HCl specimens, whereas street seizures represent
   U.S. domestic-only seizures and included both cocaine base and HCl
   specimens. U.S. (including U.S. Territories) street seizures (mean =
   24.6 months) of cocaine were 3.6 months older than all CSP seizures
   (mean = 21.0 months) and this difference was statistically signiﬁcant
   (p = 0.0043, U0 = 20101). Thus, street-level cocaine seizures were
   statistically older than the larger CSP seizures.

   When only domestic (not including U.S. Territories) street and CSP
   specimens were considered in a comparison, there was still a signiﬁcant
   difference in average ages of street seizure specimens (mean = 24.6
   months) and CSP specimens (mean = 21.3 months)(p = 0.0118, U0 = 18947).
   On average, street seizures were 3.2 months older than CSP seizures.

   Seizures of large cocaine shipments are younger than seizures of small
   cocaine shipments. The CSP components of the dataset were used to
   evaluate the effect of seizure size on seizure date. Seizures varied in
   size from small street seizures without masses recorded, to larger CSP
   and foreign seizures weighing between a few grams and in one instance,
   over 15,000 kg. There were 59 instances where multiple specimens had
   been collected and analyzed from a single seizure (domestic, n = 56;
   foreign, n = 3). The average number of independent specimens analyzed
   per seizure was 3.1, with a range between 2 and 18.

   The ages of different cocaine seizure sizes were calculated and
   specimens were assigned to one of four categories: <150 kg and <24
   months, <150 kg and >24 months, >151 kg and < 24 months or >151 kg and
   >24 months. Fisher’s Exact test showed statistically signiﬁcant
   differences in cocaine ages based on seizure size. Fishers Exact test
   was used on all cocaine seizures for which seizure size data were
   available (CSP and Foreign combined, excluding street seizures)
   (one-sided p = 0.0242) and repeated for CSP seizures only (one-sided p
   = 0.0479). These statistical results indicated that large cocaine
   seizures are younger than smaller seizures. However, Fishers Exact test
   does not indicate the average ages of specimens in the different
   categories. For CSP and foreign seizures of <150 kg, the average age
   was 22.3 months (n = 238). For CSP and foreign seizures of >150 kg, the
   average age was 18.2 months (n = 30). These two values are
   statistically different from each other (p = 0.0174, U0 = 4415.5).

   Based on these and earlier results, the average time lag between coca
   leaf production and appearance at the street level can be partitioned
   into several approximate time periods:

   􀀇 3 months = approximate age of leaf at harvest (assumes typical

   3 months between harvests).

   􀀇 18.2 􀀁 1.4 months = average age of large bulk CSP and foreign

   seizures.

   􀀇 22.3 􀀁 0.6 months = average age of a small bulk CSP and foreign

   seizures.

   􀀇 24.6 􀀁 1.1 months = average age of a U.S. street seizure.

   The pattern above strongly suggested that the largest component of the
   time lag between coca leaf production and appearance of a street
   cocaine specimen was associated with time before cocaine interception
   at the CSP level. That lag of well over a year may have been associated
   with cocaine HCl production (very unlikely) or time associated with
   cocaine accumulation and/or transit to the United States.

   Very small sample sizes allowed for limited data interpretation of
   cocaine seized in different countries. Seizures in Bolivia (age = 29.5
   months, n = 11), Brazil (age = 18.5, n = 1), Colombia (age = 16.2
   months, n = 2), Ecuador (age = 21.0 months, n = 3), and Peru (age =
   31.5 months, n = 3) may or may not have been different from each other,
   but are not interpretable based on the limited sample sizes.

   Large cocaine seizures represented accumulations of different-age
   specimens. A total of 59 seizures were each sub-sampled between 2 and
   18 times. A single 638-kg seizure from the Eastern Paciﬁc represented
   18 distinct specimens. The mean age of this cocaine seizure was 11
   months, however the range of individual specimens was 2–31 months,
   varying more than 11% in 14C. Table 2 summarizes the D14C (%) and age
   in month statistics for this unique seizure. Two additional seizures,
   one from Florida and one from Illinois, were sub-sampled and analyzed 6
   and 9 times, respectively. The seizure from Florida ranged 5.8% in
   D14C; the seizure from Illinois ranged 8.8% in D14C. By age in months,
   the Florida specimens ranged 14.8 months, the specimens from Illinois,
   almost 22.7 months.

   At this time, no clear conclusion can be made about whether or not the
   observed range in cocaine ages in a large seizure is typical of all
   cocaine seizures because of the limited number of different analyses
   within a single seizure. However, the available data suggest that large
   seizures often represented a compilation of cocaine accumulated over
   time before transiting to the United States.

   4. Discussion

   Our previous work [20] conﬁrmed that D14C were a useful tool to date
   the age of production of cocaine. The 14C content in the atmosphere
   peaked in 1963 and since that time the 14C content of the atmosphere
   has decreased as photosynthesis by land plants and marine algae take up
   14CO2 and store it within organic compounds. The exponential decrease
   in 14C content of coca leaves and extracted cocaine specimens over time
   makes 14C contents a more sensitive analytical tool for specimens
   acquired in the 1980s and 1990s than today. Nevertheless, with an
   analytical precision of about 4% for a recent individual observation,
   the signal-to-noise ratio still provides information useful to U.S.
   policy makers for estimating transit times for the time interval
   between coca leaf production and its arrival and street-level
   distribution in the United States.

   This study has provided the ﬁrst quantitative data on the time lag
   between coca production and street seizure of cocaine. The time lag
   between coca growth in South America and cocaine seizure in the United
   States averaged 24.6 months in the 2008–2009 time period. This time lag
   incorporates all steps on the way between plant growth and cocaine
   arrival in a city in the U.S., including time associated with growth in
   the ﬁeld between harvest (3 months), extraction of cocaine from coca
   leaf, and the various transit stages between Colombia and the U.S.
   Based on the cocaine specimens analyzed, there is no evidence to
   suggest that transit times for cocaine base were different from cocaine
   HCl. It is not clear whether or not the similarity in-transit times for
   cocaine base versus cocaine HCL is reasonable and we are unaware of
   independent data relevant to this point. There were no statistical
   differences in the average time lag for cocaine arrival into different
   parts of the U.S. or its territories. If the results of this study are
   veriﬁed, then D14C measurements could be a useful metric for the next
   several years to evaluate effectiveness of different drug eradication
   and interdiction policies.

   Domestic and international bulk cocaine specimens seized and sampled as
   part of the CSP were on average 3.6 months younger than U.S. street
   seizures. When only domestic CSP specimens are considered in the
   comparison, CSP seizures were still 3.2 months younger than street
   seizures. Given that CSP seizures tended to be larger, in transit
   seizures before cocaine had arrived at the street level, these time-lag
   differences were expected. The average time lag of +- 3–4 months
   between CSP- and street-seizures for cocaine suggests that trafﬁc
   transit time into the U.S. is relatively rapid without extensive time
   delays. Taken together, the 14C data suggest that the time between coca
   leaf growth and CSP seizure is far greater than the time lag between
   large CSP seizure and street-level seizures. While this observation may
   not come as a surprise, the independent conﬁrmation lends credence to
   an expected delay as cocaine is parceled out in the illicit
   distribution chain.

   Larger in-transit cocaine seizures were statistically younger than
   street-seized cocaine and larger cocaine seizures were on average
   younger than smaller cocaine seizures. Again, these observations may
   not come as a surprise, but independent D14C data provided conﬁrmation.
   The mean D14C value for each of these seizures showed a statistically
   signiﬁcant relationship between seizure sizes and age of a seized
   cocaine specimen, suggesting that large CSP cocaine seizures were
   statistically younger than smaller CSP seizures. This pattern was
   conﬁrmed both with and without foreign CSP seizures included in the
   analyses. Following the logic that cocaine is transited as larger
   shipments before being subdivided for further distribution, these
   patterns make sense. On the other hand, based on the limited
   information available for this study, it is equally plausible that both
   large and small CSP seizures left the country of origin at the same
   time, but that larger shipments made it to the U.S. faster. Because of
   the limited information available, it is not possible to delineate
   between these two possibilities. However, the D14C data do suggest that
   there is some accumulation of cocaine prior to its shipment out of
   South America or storage during transit to the United States.

   For large seizures, it appears that cocaine may have been accumulated
   prior to arrival in the United States. Three of the seizures analyzed
   contained 6–18 independent specimens, allow-ing for evaluation of the
   age distributions among specimens. Within each of these three seizures,
   the average D14C value ranged from 5.8% to 11.1%, which exceeded a
   1-year change in coca 14C content. These data suggest that in these
   large shipments cocaine may have been accumulated for a year or more
   before attempted entry into the United States. Analyses of more of
   these larger seizures in the future may provide more insights into the
   production-to-distribution strategies of cocaine trafﬁckers, especially
   in response to DEA-led interdiction efforts.

   The D14C data allow a quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of
   cocaine-reduction policies using age-based cocaine seizure data. For
   instance, is it possible to assess the implications of eradication
   and/or increased seizure efforts in Colombia on reducing the ﬂow of
   cocaine into the United States? Without a basic understanding of the
   time lags between coca leaf production and cocaine seizure, it will be
   difﬁcult to quantitatively assess the impacts of supply-reduction
   efforts on illicit drug deliveries into the United States. Data on the
   ages of cocaine specimens analyzed in this study on cocaine should aid
   U.S. policy makers as they allocate resources at different levels to
   reduce cocaine availability in the U.S. Using radiocarbon observations,
   the results showed that on average, trafﬁckers required approximately
   24 months between growth of the coca leaf in Colombia and its arrival
   at the street level in the United States. Using this time lag estimate,
   one has a quantitative parameter to monitor the effectiveness of a drug
   policy. That is, given a policy change, is there a detectable change in
   the time lag between cocaine production and street-level distribution
   in the United States.

   Finally, the results of this study indicate that larger CSP cocaine
   seizures might represent cocaine accumulated over multiple harvests
   rather than simply a single-season production. Further analyses will be
   required to effectively conclude the extent to which large shipments
   (on the order of tons) represented accumulated versus current-season’s
   production. The ramiﬁcation of having and applying this information has
   signiﬁcant policy and law enforcement implications for both the source
   and consumer ends of the cocaine-supply routes.

   The Effects of Microwave Irradiation on Occluded Solvents in Illicitly
   Produced Cocaine Hydrochloride

   REFERENCE: Morello DR, Casale JF, Stevenson ML, Klein RFX. The effects
   of microwave irradiation on occluded solvents in illicitly produced
   cocaine hydrochloride. J Forensic Sci 2000;45(5): 1126–1132.

   ABSTRACT: The current clandestine methodology for the manu-facture of
   illicit cocaine hydrochloride utilizes microwave heating in order to
   dry the finished product. This study addresses the effects this step
   has on the occluded solvents present in newly prepared cocaine
   hydrochloride. Nine 1-kilogram-sized batches of cocaine hy-drochloride
   were prepared from cocaine base using a variety of solvents or solvent
   mixtures commonly utilized in clandestine laboratories, pressed into
   bricks, and submitted to microwave heating. Residual solvents were
   qualitatively and quantitatively monitored before, during, and
   following the microwaving step by static headspace-gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. All solvents used in the conversion
   process were easily detected in the bricks even after extensive
   irradiation, confirming that occluded solvents are extremely resistant
   to removal by microwave heating. Qualitative and quantitative data
   corresponding to the residual solvents in the prepared cocaine
   hydrochloride bricks are presented.

   KEYWORDS: forensic science, cocaine hydrochloride, gas chromatography,
   static headspace, mass spectrometry, microwave irradiation, occluded
   solvents

   Illicit cocaine hydrochloride is typically prepared by the addition of
   a solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a moderately polar
   organic solvent to a second solution of cocaine base dissolved in a
   relatively nonpolar organic solvent or solvents (1). This procedure
   usually results in rapid precipitation of cocaine hydrochloride, which
   in turn causes small quantities of the solvents used in the
   base-to-hydrochloride conversion to be trapped (i.e., “occluded”)
   within the crystal matrix. The analysis of illicit cocaine
   hydrochloride for these residual solvents has been per-formed by
   various methodologies (2–7), the most rigorous being a qualitative and
   quantitative procedure utilizing static headspace-gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (SHS-GC-MS) (8). The results are
   useful both for comparative analyses and intelligence-gathering
   purposes (9,10), such as monitoring the use and diversion of solvents
   utilized in the manufacture of illicit cocaine hydrochloride.

   Beginning in the mid-1980s, clandestine laboratory operators in South
   America began using microwave ovens to dry compressed bricks of cocaine
   hydrochloride prior to packaging and shipping. The use of microwave
   ovens expanded rapidly and is currently the predominant drying method.
   Prior to this point, drying was accomplished using a slower, less
   effective combination of conventional ovens, heat lamps, electric or
   gas-fired grills, and fans. All of these conventional methods transfer
   heat from the brick’s surface in-ward, whereas microwave heating
   transfers heat from inside the brick outward. Because of the inherent
   differences between microwave and conventional heating, it was unclear
   what effect(s), if any, microwaving would have on the resulting
   occluded solvent impurity profiles of the cocaine hydrochloride. This
   knowledge is critical in order to maintain the efficacy and validity of
   the moni-toring and intelligence-gathering aspects of residual solvent
   analyses. Specifically, it was important to determine whether: (a) the
   sum total of occluded solvents would be significantly decreased;(b)
   whether certain solvents, particularly low-boiling solvents, would be
   selectively reduced or eliminated; and (c) whether new “artifactual”
   solvents would be produced by microwave-enhanced reactions occurring
   within the occluded solvent reservoirs in the crystal matrix.

   To our knowledge, the effects of microwave irradiation upon occluded
   solvents have not been addressed for any illicit drug. Herein, we
   present the results of a study of both the qualitative and quantitative
   effects of microwaving on occluded solvents in compressed bricks of
   cocaine hydrochloride.

   Experimental

   Solvents, Chemicals, Standards and Materials

   All solvents used for cocaine base to hydrochloride conversion were
   “distilled-in-glass products” of Burdick and Jackson Labs (Muskegon,
   MI). Hydrochloric acid (36.5 to 38%) was obtained from J. T. Baker
   (Phillipsburg, NJ), and was of reagent grade quality. All other
   chemicals and solvents were reagent grade or better. Illicit cocaine
   hydrochloride was obtained from confiscated stocks at the Drug
   Enforcement Administration’s Southeast Laboratory (Miami, FL). Internal
   standards used in the SHS-GC-MS analysis (acetone-d6, isopropanol-d8,
   toluene-d8, 2-chloro-2-methyl-propane-d9 and n-hexane-d14) were
   obtained from Cambridge Iso-tope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Deionized
   water, filtered through a Millipore Milli-Q™ System (Bedford, MA) to
   remove trace organic impurities, was used for all sample and standard
   solutions. The reaction vials and corresponding Mininert™ valve caps
   used to store standard solutions were supplied by Pierce (Rockford, IL)
   and Supelco (Bellefonte, PA), respectively. Headspace vials, 20 mL,
   were clear 20 mm 􀀁 75 mm glass with corresponding silicone/Teflon™
   septa crimp caps (Phase Separations, Inc., Norwalk, CT.)

   Instrumentation and Equipment

   Two similar automated SHS-GC-MS configurations were uti-lized,
   differing only in their associated mass spectrometers. All quantitative
   analyses were performed on the first instrument con-figuration, which
   utilized a more sensitive Ion-Trap MS detector (detailed below).
   Instrument settings are as follows for both con-figurations: solvent
   concentration was performed by a Tekmar SHS 7000/7050
   Headspace-Autosampler Combination, fitted with a 2.0 mL stainless steel
   sample loop and a heated nickel transfer line. The headspace settings
   were: platen temperature, 80°C; trans-fer line temperature, 180°C;
   valve/line temperature, 180°C; vial size, 20 mL; mixer time, 15 min;
   mixer power, 1; vial pressurize time, 0.3 min; pressure/loop
   equilibration time, 0.05 min; loop fill, 0.2 min; and inject time, 1.5
   min.

   Separation of the liberated residual solvents was performed in both
   configurations by Hewlett-Packard Model 5890 Series II Gas
   Chromatographs fitted with 60 􀀁 0.25 mm inside diameter fused silica
   capillary columns coated with 1 􀀂m DB-1 (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA).
   Helium (UHP) was used as the carrier gas, at an average linear velocity
   of 23 cm/s. The GCs were temperature programmed as follows: initial
   temperature, 40°C; initial hold, 14 min; temperature program rate,
   7°C/min; final temperature, 210°C; fi-nal hold, 3 min. The injector
   temperatures were maintained at 180°C with a split ratio of 8:1.

   Detection and identification were performed by a Finnigan-Mat Model 800
   Ion Trap Detector (ITD) and a Hewlett-Packard Model 5972 Mass Selective
   Detector for the first and second configura-tions, respectively.
   Instrument settings were: scan range, 20 to 230 amu; scan/s, 2; acquire
   time, 42 min; transfer line temperature, 200°C; scan mode, full;
   filament/multiplier delay, 4 min.

   Microwave irradiation of the cocaine hydrochloride bricks was performed
   with a Magic Chef Model DM5H-3 1200 watt microwave oven (Anniston, AL).
   The oven was set at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, resulting in the magneto
   being energized 50% of the selected time frame, in one-second
   increments.

   Preparation of Cocaine Hydrochloride Bricks

   Cocaine base was prepared from confiscated illicit cocaine
   hy-drochloride by dissolving the latter in water, precipitating the
   free base by the addition of dilute ammonium hydroxide, filtering, and
   drying to constant weight using heat lamps at 60°C. Solvent analy-sis
   of the dried base by SHS-GC-MS indicated no carry-over of any residual
   solvents present in the starting materials.

   Nine solvent mixtures were used in the base-to-hydrochloride
   conversions (Table 1). In each case, approximately 1 kg of the dried
   base was dissolved in 10 L of solvent mix A, which then was filtered
   and set aside. Approximately 230 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid
   was dissolved in 10 L of solvent B, and the resulting solution then was
   rapidly added to solvent mix A (cocaine base solution) with stirring;
   resulting in rapid precipitation of cocaine hydrochloride. The combined
   mixture was allowed to stand for 1 to 2 h to complete the
   crystallization process, after which the product was collected by
   suction filtration and dried under high-intensity heat lamps until its
   appearance was no longer wet. The resulting damp, crys-talline powder
   was then compressed into 8 in. 􀀁 5.5 in. 􀀁 1 in. (~ 20 􀀁 14 􀀁 2.5 cm)
   bricks using a wooden mold and a hydraulic press applying a maximum
   pressure of 16 tons/in.2 Each compressed brick, still moist with
   solvent and varying from off-white to white in color, was removed from
   the mold and stored in a plastic bag prior to microwave irradiation.
   The conversion procedures and selected solvents were in accordance with
   current methodologies in use by illicit laboratory operators in South
   America.

   Microwave Irradiation, Sampling, and Occluded Solvent Analyses of
   Cocaine Hydrochloride Bricks

   Each brick was handled independently and essentially identi-cally; each
   was removed from its plastic bag, placed on a previously tared
   microwave tray, accurately weighed, sampled, and immediately subjected
   to microwave irradiation. Each brick was irradiated for 3 min, removed
   for a 15 min cooling period (during which time it was again weighed and
   sampled), then returned to the oven for additional irradiation. Total
   irradiation times varied from 15 to 24 min, i.e., five to eight 3-min
   sessions, intentionally longer than the 8 to 12 min typically used in
   the clandestine process (based on clandestine laboratory operator
   interviews, 1993–1996), in order to monitor the maximum effects on the
   occluded solvents. As the brick temperatures increased, it was common
   to observe hot solvents leach from the brick onto the microwave tray
   and rapidly evaporate. The actual temperatures of the bricks were not
   monitored, but they quickly reached the point where they could not be
   manipulated by hand without protective (thermal) gloves. By the final
   irradiation session, the bricks had achieved the characteristically
   dry, hardened appearance of clandestinely manufactured bricks.
   Following the final irradiation session, each brick was again weighed
   and sampled.

   All samples were taken using a standard 0.8 cm outside diame-ter cork
   borer. The removed material was punched out of the borer into a glass
   vial, weighed and held for future SHS-GC-MS analysis. All samples were
   left open to air to allow final evaporation of any remaining
   nonoccluded solvent(s). The average amount of material removed by the
   cork borer during each sampling was about 500 mg. The respective
   weights of the removed samples were taken into account when determining
   brick weights.

   For each sample, a single 30 mg equivalent of cocaine hy-drochloride
   was removed for SHS-GC-MS analysis. The workup and analysis of each
   sample were identical to the previously described protocol (8), except
   that only single (not triplicate) analyses were performed, and 30 (not
   15) mg equivalents of cocaine hydrochloride were used. In addition,
   method blanks containing the five deuterated internal standards were
   analyzed by SHS-GC-MS to identify any isotopic impurities; no
   detectable impurities were observed.

   Results and Discussion

   In general, there are two types of solvents associated with the
   precipitation of cocaine hydrochloride from organic solutions:
   “wetting” solvents, i.e., those adhering to the outside surfaces of the
   crystals, and “occluded” solvents, i.e., those trapped in interstitial
   cavities created throughout the crystal matrix during crystal growth.
   The crude production techniques utilized in clandestine laboratories
   (i.e., rapid precipitation) are especially conducive to occlusion of
   the precipitating media. Prior studies have indicated significant
   quantities of occluded solvents in illicit cocaine hydrochloride,
   typically varying from 0.1 to 1.5% (2–8). Most of these studies were
   completed before the advent of microwaving in clandestine laboratories,
   and therefore offer valid baseline data for comparison. Analysis of
   pharmaceutical grade cocaine hydrochloride, which is produced slowly
   and under cold conditions, indicated occluded solvents at only the
   0.005 % level.

   It was previously suspected that occluded solvents would be
   dramatically impacted by microwave heating—a suspicion lent additional
   credence by the high brick temperatures observed during the irradiation
   sessions (well above the boiling points of the more volatile solvents
   utilized to precipitate the cocaine hydrochloride.) Surprisingly,
   however, the sample analyses indicate only moderate effects (Fig. 1).
   Total occluded solvent levels in the nine bricks ranged from 0.13 to
   2.1% before and 0.10 to 1.7% after irradiation, respectively. These
   values compare favorably with those derived in the prior (i.e.,
   pre-microwave) studies. Furthermore, each individual solvent, including
   highly volatile solvents such as diethyl ether and methylene chloride,
   appear equally unaffected (Table 2, Fig. 2). The collective results
   confirm that microwave irradiation of illicit cocaine hydrochloride
   bricks does not significantly diminish individual or total occluded
   solvent levels.

   FIG. 1—Total percent occluded solvents before and after microwaving
   (see Table 2 for brick identifications).


   The unexpected resistance of occluded solvents to removal via microwave
   heating prompted additional studies into qualitative and quantitative
   analyses. Of particular interest was the relationship between the
   occluded solvent ratios and the makeup of the original precipitating
   media used in the base to hydrochloride conversions (Table 3). In
   general, the correlations are not very good. The best agreement is
   noted for Brick #4 (6:6:1 ethyl acetate/methyl ethyl ketone/toluene),
   with an occluded solvent ratio of 5:4:1. However, poor correlations
   were noted in bricks where nonpolar solvents were utilized. This is
   best illustrated by Bricks #6 (2:2:1 hexane/methylene chloride/toluene)
   and 7 (10:10:1 hexane/methyl ethyl ketone/methylene chloride), with
   occluded solvent ratios of 1:250:20 and 2:5:1, respectively. These
   results suggest that nonpolar solvents are less susceptible to
   occlusion in cocaine hydrochloride than polar solvents. However,
   additional factors other than solvent polarity may influence occlusion
   of solvents, including rate of precipitation, conversion solution
   temperature, degree of mixing, and percent water in the precipitating
   media.

   Another point of interest was the fate of trace level solvents pre-sent
   as contaminants in the primary conversion solvents. First, it was
   determined that the method blanks run with the five deuterated internal
   standards contained no detectable impurities that might contribute to
   the solvent profiles (e.g., toluene in toluene-d8.) Preliminary
   SHS-GC-MS analyses of each of the primary solvents utilized in this
   study indicated 0.05% toluene in methyl ethyl ketone and 1.0% mesityl
   oxide in acetone. It has long been suspected that these contaminants
   could be carried through the conversion process and therefore persist
   as occluded solvents. In fact, analyses of those bricks produced with
   either methyl ethyl ketone or acetone confirmed trace amounts of
   toluene and mesityl oxide, respec-tively, in the occluded solvent
   mixtures. However, care must be taken in interpreting the latter
   result, since mesityl oxide is a condensation product of acetone, and
   may legitimately be expected to arise as a result of the reaction of
   acetone within the occluded solvent reservoirs during irradiation.

   In order to test this hypothesis even more rigorously, one brick (Brick
   #9) was manufactured with a 100:100:(1 􀀁 16) diethyl
   ether/acetone/”spiked components” conversion mixture (i.e., the 16
   spiked components were each added to the conversion mixture at 1/100th
   the concentration of diethyl ether and acetone). Notably, all 16 were
   easily detected in the subsequent occluded solvent analysis; Fig. 3
   illustrates the reconstructed total ion chromatogram for Brick #9 after
   15 min of collective irradiation, while Fig. 4 displays the relative
   concentrations of all 18 solvent components. These results confirm that
   trace level contaminant solvents present in the precipitating media are
   retained in the occluded solvent reservoirs (and also demonstrates the
   viability of “tagging” bulk solvents for enforcement purposes).

   A related issue involved the question of “artifactual” solvents, i.e.,
   new solvents arising from intra- and/or intermolecular reactions of
   occluded solvents during microwave irradiation. The best known example
   of this phenomenon is methanol, which arises from hydrolysis of cocaine
   itself, and is ubiquitous in all occluded solvent analyses of cocaine
   hydrochloride. Similar artifacts were anticipated from condensation,
   hydrolysis or solvolysis of (espe-cially) ester- and/or ketone-based
   occluded solvents. Somewhat surprisingly, however, very few such
   solvents were observed in this study. Most notably, mesitylene (another
   acetone condensation product, similar to mesityl oxide, which was not
   detected in the acetone originally utilized as a primary solvent) was
   detected in all bricks precipitated from conversion solvents containing
   acetone. Furthermore, the relative concentrations of both mesityl oxide
   and mesitylene increased during the irradiation steps, confirming that
   they were being created during microwave heating.

   Finally, although the primary goal of this study was to monitor the
   effects of microwave irradiation on occluded solvents, it also offered
   a unique opportunity to monitor the effectiveness of microwave drying
   of cocaine hydrochloride bricks in clandestine settings. Not
   surprisingly, all nine bricks studied exhibited significant decreases
   in weight as a result of microwave drying (Table 2). Collective losses
   ranged from 3 to 27%, with an average loss of 10%. The large variance
   of losses suggests that certain solvents or sol-vent mixtures are more
   effective “wetting” agents; however, there do not appear to be any
   correlations between the boiling points, mobilities, or polarities of
   the various solvents and their retention as wetting solvents on cocaine
   hydrochloride. As expected, the collective results confirm the efficacy
   of microwaves for drying cocaine hydrochloride bricks.

   Conclusions

   In summary, this study has established, first, that occluded solvents
   in cocaine hydrochloride are extremely resistant to removal by
   microwave heating; second, that even low-boiling occluded sol-vents
   (e.g., diethyl ether or methylene chloride) are equally unaffected by
   microwave heating versus higher boiling solvents, even when excessive
   overheating is employed; third, that trace-level solvents present in
   primary conversion solvents are carried through the conversion process
   and persist as occluded solvents; fourth, that although the occluded
   solvents accurately reflect the components of the original
   precipitating media, they are at best only roughly indicative of the
   original ratios of those components (however, differentiation between
   primary conversion solvents and trace-level contaminants is routinely
   accomplished via quantitation); and fifth, that certain artifactual
   solvents (e.g., mesitylene) are created within the occluded solvent
   reservoirs during microwave heating. The collective results confirm
   that analysis of residual solvents in illicit cocaine hydrochloride for
   diversion monitoring and intelligence gathering purposes remains valid
   despite the wholesale adoption of microwave over conventional drying in
   clandestine laboratories.

   If you did not know by now that Levamisole is a dangerous substance to
   be ingesting with your cocaine, then you ought to spend a little time
   here to do some research. It could save you or a friend's life!

   One of the things that they try to claim about buying drugs from the
   Dark Net Markets is that it is safer than buying drugs from the
   streets. That can be a debatable depending on where you are located and
   whom you might know, there are too many variables maybe to ever prove
   this one way or another.

   The only way that maybe we can sway the Dark Net Markets of being
   consistently the safer place to go to is by keeping as many people on
   the Dark Net informed and working together in concert so we might be
   able to make a safer marketplace actually happen.

   This section of the Concerned Cocaine Citizens onion website is about
   the dangers of Levamisole. We will try to scour the interwebs to find
   all the information that we can on this subject, including linking you
   to as many news article, internet exposés and stories all here so that
   this all can be easily found in one location.

   Once you are convinced that you think people should be warned about
   Levamisole, please refer them to this section of the website.

   excerpted from The New England Journal of Medicine:

   Toxic Effects of Levamisole in a Cocaine User m7

   A 54-year-old woman presented with a 2-day history of a painful,
   enlarging rash over her face (Panel A), ears (Panel B), breasts, and
   extremities. Laboratory studies revealed neutropenia (neutrophil count,
   1070 per cubic millimeter) and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 680 per
   cubic millimeter); the detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic
   antibodies (ANCA) by immunofluorescence testing showed the perinuclear
   pattern (p-ANCA) and the cytoplasmic pattern (c-ANCA), and an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed a proteinase-3 antibody
   titer of 1:320. Toxicologic screening of the urine was positive for
   cocaine and opiates. The urine levamisole level 2 days after admission
   was positive at 920 ng per milliliter. A biopsy specimen of skin with
   the rash showed purpura, with focal intravascular fibrin formation that
   was consistent with vasculopathy.

   m8 Treatment with methylprednisolone and prednisone did not result in
   improvement, and the patient underwent extensive débridement of the
   necrotic tissue. The clinical findings were consistent with the toxic
   effects of levamisole, including bone marrow suppression and
   ANCA-positive vasculopathy. Levamisole, an antihelmintic agent for use
   in animals, is a common additive to cocaine and is speculated to
   enhance the euphoric effect. Levamisole toxicity resulting from the use
   of adulterated cocaine may be an increasing problem and should be
   considered in a cocaine user with neutropenia and reticular purpura.
   The patient has undergone numerous reconstructive surgical procedures,
   and her care has been complicated by wound infections.

   Follow these instructions to remove the [3]LEVAMISOLE from your cocaine
   at home with these easy to follow instructions!


   Do you have a personal story about having to deal with levamisole on a
   personal level, like you or a friend or loved one having to be
   hospitalized because of levamisole? We are considering adding a page
   for such accounts. Of course we will keep it totally anonymous, or if
   you like, we could use your DN handle. Send us an email at

   In 2011 a team of physicians from University Of South Florida Morsani
   College Of Medicine in Tampa, FL (under the attending service of John
   Sinnott, MD FACP) recognized an association of skin necrosis with use
   of levamisole adulterated cocaine. The mnemonic LINES was coined to
   name the syndrome because the name was descriptive, reminds one of a
   line of cocaine, and is easily remembered. So now there is a known and
   named medical condition for the ingesting and poisoning of levamisole!

   [21]https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/cocaine/cocaine_article2.shtml


   Levamisole in Gastric Content after Unusual Intake of Heroin and
   Cocaine:
   Levamisole is an antibiotic medication used to treat colon cancer and
   is a synthetic imidazothiazole derivative also employed as an
   antihelminthic to treat worm infestations in both humans and animals.
   [22]http://scitechnol.com/2325-9841/2325-9841-2-102.php?article_id=640
   The above explains why there are oral tablets made of this drug.


   Most cocaine diluted with unsafe livestock drug:

   At San Francisco General Hospital, where the first cases of the illness
   were diagnosed, 90 percent of 200 patients who recently tested positive
   for cocaine also tested positive for levamisole.

   m21

   "The big question we have right now is, if 90 percent of cocaine users
   in San Francisco are positive for levamisole and are being exposed to
   this compound, then why aren't 90 percent of them in the emergency room
   with these side effects?" said Kara Lynch, associate chief of the
   chemistry and toxicology lab at S.F. General.

   On December 29th 2014 Doctor X (Fernando Caudevilla, a family physician
   from Spain) on the Evolution forums answered a question posed by
   iamdying about the possible dangers of ingesting levamisole and this is
   his reply:

   [25]http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?pid=368891#p368891

   Levamisole can induce toxicity by two different ways. Dosages greater
   than 200 mg daily can be toxic, and, as you say, it is very unlikely
   that cuts of cocaine can be harmful in this sense, as it is very
   difficult to reach this daily dosage even with heavy cocaine use and
   high adulterated cocaine. But levamisole induces toxicity also by
   immunologic mechanisms. In some persons, by genetic reasons, levamisol
   is toxic even with little dosages. This causes dermatological and
   haematological diseases. And, in fact, almost all cases of
   levamisole-contaminated cocaine toxicity are produced by this
   mechanism.

   So levamisole can be toxic even in low doses and there is no way to
   predict which persons are susceptible to this effect. So there is no
   "acceptable amount" of levamisole to be accepted as a cut. As you say,
   levamisole addition is a global phenomenon and in many cases has its
   origin in the countries where cocaine is produced. Up to 50% of samples
   of cocaine contain levamisole and that is a big problem.

   The problem with Drug Testing Services as provided by Energy Control
   (http://energycontrol.org/noticias/528-international.html) is that they
   can only be used as a guarantee for final user. It can not be used as a
   guarantee of a vendor or a product. First of all these kind of services
   are designed as a preventive tool and using it as guarantee for vendors
   could have negative legal consequences (I know, this is absurd but that
   is how policy drugs work). But a Drug Testing Service can not guarantee
   that a vendor will analyze all the batchs, or the batch analyzed in one
   moment is the same that is being sold. Drug Markets Administrators can
   not control this also. In the case we analyzed a toxic substance and we
   knew who is the vendor, we would make public this information. To the
   moment, luckily, it has not happened yet.

   How you can remove levamisole from your cocaine at home!

   You have to obtain some chloroform to do this.

   It is advisable that an acetone wash to be done in conjunction with the
   Chloroform washing to remove any other impurities and the “bad” or
   unnecessary alkaloids. Please [16]see this webpage for those
   instructions.


   This posted by Le Junk on November 19, 2005 on Bluelight

   CHEMICALS AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED

   chloroform (any online chemical supply company)

   15 cm. in diameter, medium flow filter papers (any online chemical or
   chemistry supply company.)

   4-5 inch diameter plastic funnel (any auto parts store)

   9 inch glass Pyrex pie plate (Walmart)

   (1) 50 ml. glass Pyrex beaker

   (1) 6 inch glass stir rod

   lab stand with funnel ring (any online chemistry supply company)

   EDIT 1/28/15: USE ICE COLD CHLORFORM!

   REMOVAL OF EPHEDRINE (This was written for ephedrine, but it is the
   same procedure for levamisole. For this page below where ephedrine was
   written we will add levamisole also.)

   Alright, it takes exactly 12.5 ml.s of chloroform to dissolve 1 gram of
   cocaine. Ephedrine and levamisole are entirely insoluble in chloroform.
   But, since we know our adulterated cocaine is not 100% pure, I would
   strongly suggest going on the light side with the chloroform. I
   personally use 10 ml.s of chloroform for every 1 gram of cocaine.

   Note: In this procedure, I will be using exactly 3 grams of adulterated
   cocaine as the given amount. Okay, here we go........................

   Fill your 50 ml. beaker with 30 ml.s of ICE COLD chloroform. Crush up
   your 3 grams of cocaine and add it to the chloroform. With the glass
   stir rod, stir the mixture thoroughly for about 3-5 minutes. It may
   appear as pearlescent looking liquid with possibly no residue on the
   bottom. That doesn't mean the ephedrine isn't floating in the liquid.
   In fact, it most likely is. Your cocaine at this point is completely
   dissolved into the chloroform. Anything left in solid form is anything
   other than cocaine, regardless of how good it might look.

   Now, take one of your filter papers, fold it in half so it's in the
   shape of a half circle. Fold it over again into kind of a triangle.
   Open up one of the two openings and place the filter paper inside of
   the plastic funnel (make sure you cut off the bottom tip of the plastic
   funnel right up to the bottom of the V before using it). This will
   assure that none of the liquid actually hits the plastic funnel on the
   way out. Now, carefully push the filter paper down as far as you can
   inside of the funnel so that the bottom tip of the filter paper is just
   barely sticking out the bottom of the funnel. Place your pie plate on
   the lab stand with your funnel ring about 4 inches above the plate and
   your funnel and filter paper placed inside of the funnel ring. You'll
   want the bottom of your funnel to be about 1 inch from the surface of
   the pie plate. This will assure that the liquid does not splash all
   over the place when it drains thru the funnel. You will need a friend
   to hold down the filter paper and keep it open until the liquid is
   poured in. You'll understand once your in this position.

   Once the filter is in place and being held on one side by a friend,
   carefully but fairly quickly, pour your entire contents of
   chloroform/cocaine into the filter paper. Your chloroform/cocaine will
   quickly begin to fall thru the filter paper onto the awaiting pie
   plate. Once done, anything left in the beaker can be washed down the
   drain. It's junk! Once all of the liquid is in the filter paper, your
   friend can now let go of it. It will now stay in place by itself with
   the liquid inside. Quickly cover the top of the funnel with a paper
   towel so that no moisture from the air gets in. Now, walk away and let
   the filter finish completely draining all of the chloroform/cocaine out
   onto the awaiting pie plate. The liquid should be completely clear at
   this point and look just like plain old water. I would advise that you
   do this procedure in an open area, as chloroform can cause eye
   irritation and headaches.

   Once all of the liquid has drained thru, you can now carefully remove
   the filter paper from the funnel, open it up and see just how much
   ephedrine or levamisole, along with anything else that isn't cocaine,
   is actually in there. Now put that filter paper, along with the crap
   inside of it, where it belongs...................down the toilet!

   ****Below, I will list two different methods you can use to let cocaine
   crystals form out of the goo. The first is for those of you which not
   only enjoy quality, but beauty as well. The second, impatient method,
   is for those of you that have gotta get 'er done right now!

   CONNOISSEUR METHOD

   Now, if your a true connoisseur of art and all it's beauty, simply take
   a clean regular blow dryer and from a distance of about 12 inches away
   and facing away from you, carefully blow dry and evaporate off the
   chloroform liquid portion now in the pie plate. Once done, you'll now
   be left with a clear goo on the bottom of the pie plate. Once your at
   this point, let the nearly pure cocaine crystals continue to form on
   their own overnight out of the goo (crystals will form slowly, so find
   something else to do while waiting, like sleeping overnight). In the
   morning, you will awake to a pie plate full of beautiful, nearly pure,
   transparent looking cocaine crystals! Simply scrape them up from the
   pie plate with a sharp razor blade and into a pile of what will now
   resemble bleach white diamonds!

   IMPATIENT METHOD

   For those of you in a hurry, follow the same method above, but instead
   of letting the crystals form on their own overnight, simply have a
   friend hold the blow dryer on cool over the plate while you take your
   index finger and go back and forth over the goo until it starts to turn
   white. Once it starts turning white, remove your finger from the pie
   plate, wipe the excess cocaine onto the edge, and continue to blow dry
   on cool until the contents turn completely white and/or can be scraped
   up with a razor blade. This usually takes around 5-10 minutes total.

   It is important that if you choose to stop here, that you let the
   cocaine crystals continue to evaporate on their own overnight. It is
   not healthy to consume any amount of chloroform. But, chloroform will
   evaporate down to .001% on it's own, but it will involve evaporation
   overnight to get there. Do not forget this, okay?

   The following was excerpted from “A Brief History of Cocaine” by Steven
   B. Karch, M.D.

   Celebrity Endorsements


   The literature of cocaine is more voluminous than valuable, more
   expectant than exact.

   J.T. Brown, 1886


   Question: What is your opinion of coca leaf?


   J.K. Visalia, California


   Answer: The virtues of coca leaves have probably been exaggerated; but
   in our opinion, nevertheless, they possess very remarkable
   properties.... Although we have had no personal experience, we consider
   the reports in their favor sufficient to warrant giving them a trial.

   From a letter to the editor of the Druggists Circular and Chemical

   Gazette, September 1876


   In the 1880s, the name most often associated with coca belonged neither
   to Sigmund Freud nor Karl Koller, the man credited with inventing local
   anesthesia. At the turn of the century, mention of cocaine brought to
   mind only one name -Angelo Mariani, and his coca-based wine, Vin
   Mariani.

   Mariani (Figure 4.1) was a Corsican, born at Pero-Casevecchie in 1838.
   He died in 1914 at his villa in Saint-Raphael, outside of Paris.
   Mariani's early history is vague, made even vaguer by Mariani's
   penchant for self-promoting publicity. It can be said, with reasonable
   certainty, that Mariani worked as an apprentice pharmacist in Paris at
   Chantrels, a pharmacy located on the Rue de Clichy. Sometime during his
   apprenticeship years, Mariani moved to another pharmacy in
   Saint-Germain. He always claimed that he was a certified pharmacist,
   and his death certificate supports that claim, but there is no record
   that he ever passed the examination required for certification.

   AngelomarianiFig41260w327h Figure 4.1 Angelo Mariani.

   He first produced a coca wine when he was still working as an assistant
   at Chantrels Pharmacy in late 1868 or early 1869. Part of his job
   description was to assist in the preparation of "wine tonics." At the
   time, medications were often prescribed in the form of wine tonics.
   Many of the then-popular drugs were foul tasting. The wine made them
   more palatable, and as a practical matter, most of the medications
   dissolved more easily in alcohol than in water. A French pharmacopoeia,
   an early ancestor of the modern Physicians Desk Reference (PDR)
   published in 1844, listed 100 medicinal wines. By 1884, that number had
   grown to 154.

   Mariani read of the miraculous properties of coca and was surprised
   that no one had yet conceived the idea of combining coca with wine.
   When a famous actress of the Comedie-Francaise came to Chantrels
   complaining of depression, Mariani recommend a coca wine. The depressed
   actress rapidly improved, and she was soon recommending Mariani's
   mixture to her friends. At some point, and it is not exactly clear
   when, Mariani decided to leave the pharmacy and go into business for
   himself. By 1870, Vin Mariani was being sold all over France. Mariani's
   Paris office was located at 41 Boulevard Haussmann. As sales increased,
   he opened additional branch offices, including one in London and
   another in New York City.

   Although he may have read about it in a short book published in the
   1880s, most of what Mariani knew about coca, he probably learned from
   his cousin, Charles Fauvel. Fauvel, born in Amiens, France, in 1830,
   was a physician. He was one of the first ear, nose, and throat
   specialists in Paris, or anywhere else for that matter. Fauvel had a
   celebrity practice and mainly reated famous singers and opera stars.
   One of the reasons for Fauvel's success was that his treatment usually
   produced good results. The reason his results were so good was that he
   found a way to effectively anesthetize the throat. With adequate
   anesthesia, it became possible to do more thorough examinations and
   perform more extensive surgical procedures.

   Although Koller later received credit for discovering that cocaine
   drops could anesthetize the eye, Fauvel observed, almost a quarter of a
   century earlier, that application of a coca tincture (an alcohol
   solution in which coca leaves were dissolved) could make throat surgery
   painless. Surgeons came from the United States and other countries to
   study Fauvel's techniques, and igmund Freud even gave Fauvel credit for
   his discovery when he published “On Coca.” Even so, Fauvel received
   little recognition, while Mariani, by virtue of his great commercial
   success, became famous. Mariani was a master at self-promotion, and it
   is difficult to decide which of his two great inventions he should be
   remembered for: the discovery of coca wine, or the invention of the
   modern publicity campaign.

   Justus von Liebig may have been the first famous scientist to make
   money by promoting his own product line, but Mariani was the first to
   collect celebrity endorsements and use them to sell his own product.
   Typical Mariani endorsements are shown in Figure 4.4 through Figure
   4.7. Mariani's early advertising campaigns were aimed mainly at
   doctors. He would send the doctors free wine samples, asking that in
   return they send him an endorsement for his product. By 1902, Mariani
   had amassed letters of praise from more than 8000 physicians and other
   happy clients from around the world. Many of these endorsements were
   then included in other Mariani publications.

   Mariani also wrote and printed scientific brochures and monographs ,
   and these too were distributed free of charge to physicians. Not
   surprisingly, the brochures always contained endorsements, if not from
   media stars and artists, then from physicians claiming impressive
   cures. Leaving nothing to chance, Mariani also advertised in the Paris
   newspapers. Prominent graphic artists, such as Cheret and Robida, were
   commissioned to produce graphics for those newspaper advertisements.
   The same artists were paid to draw posters that were displayed around
   Paris. There was also a line of medallions and plaques, each with a
   different Vin Mariani endorsement .

   Mariani soon found himself challenged by an army of competitors, and
   product recognition became a problem. Modern winemakers in California,
   who have sued one another for appropriating the distinctive shapes of
   their wine bottles, may be surprised to learn that similar scenarios
   were played out more than a century ago. Mariani had a bottle
   especially designed for his wine, and he never changed its shape. The
   Mariani wine bottle was as recognizable then as the Coca-Cola bottle is
   today. Advertisements in medical journals warned members of the medical
   profession about the "disappointment and annoyance caused by imitations
   and substitutions" and advised them to "impress on patients to accept
   only Mariani Wine ."

   Mariani liked to be around famous people. He often rented Le Doyen, a
   well-known Parisian restaurant, and served opulent dinners to members
   of the Society of French Artists. Art nouveau illustrators, of course,
   drew menus for these gatherings. A painting of one of these dinners by
   the artist Grun shows Mariani seated among the famous guests. Mariani
   also commissioned established writers, paying them to produce stories
   about the marvelous effects of coca and of his wine. The same artists
   and writers also volunteered enthusiastic endorsements for Mariani's
   products.

   Some artists even produced lithographed albums of biographical notes,
   photographs, autographs, and accounts of the many wonderful experiences
   they had while they were drinking Vin Mariani. According to Joseph
   Uzanne, Mariani's secretary and publicity director, the artists sent
   the first letters spontaneously, but eventually it became a cash
   transaction. From 1891 to 1913, Mariani published a series of albums,
   each containing 75 profiles . Lalauze, a respected illustrator,
   lithographed these profiles. Cheaper anthology additions were also
   produced.

   A total of 1086 celebrity portraits was published. The list of
   celebrities included three popes, sixteen kings and queens, and six
   presidents of the French Republic. There were also painters, sculptors,
   composers, actors, politicians, generals, bishops, physicians, and
   respected scientists. Most of the profiled celebrities were French, but
   Americans were not totally ignored. Later editions to the series
   included both the investor Thomas Edison and the actress Sarah
   Bernhardt. Different celebrities made different kinds of contributions.
   H.G. Wells drew two small cartoons of himself. In the first, he was
   slouched and depressed. In the second, a happy-looking Wells is shown
   drinking Vin Mariani. President William McKinley's secretary, John
   Addison Porter, wrote to Mariani and thanked him for the case of wine
   he sent to the White House. Porter assured Mariani that the wine would
   be used whenever the occasion presented itself. A complete set of these
   endorsement albums can be still be seen at the British Museum ( Figure
   4.2).

   The celebrity folios were expensive and were designed to reach an
   influential, if limited, audience. To increase product recognition,
   Mariani reprinted extracts taken from the folios. He republished
   biographies of individual celebrities and issued them as bulletins. The
   bulletins were then inserted in local papers around Paris. These
   bulletins, or supplements, were similar to the promotions used by
   supermarkets and department stores today. The supplements were folded
   into the centers of leading Parisian newspapers under the title,
   Contemporary Figures. Each issue was 16 pages long, and measured 32 cm
   x 23 cm.

   Fig42420w556h Figure 4.2 A typical endorsement for Vin Mariani, this
   one featuring the Pope. Hundreds, if not thousands, of members of
   French and European High Society contributed similar endorsements. This
   advertisement, with a picture of the Pope, appeared in a London
   newspaper in 1899. A complete collection can be seen at the British
   Museum. From the author's private collection.

   The magnitude of Mariani's promotional campaigns is hard to grasp. He
   printed 800,000 copies of Contemporary Figures at a time, and had them
   inserted into Le Journal, Le Monde, L'Eclair, Le Figaro, and half a
   dozen other major newspapers. Over the 20 years of publication, more
   than 64 million issues of Mariani's Contemporary Figures were
   distributed. Mariani squeezed additional mileage out of the supplements
   by taking individual photographs from the albums and reprinting them as
   postcards. Four different series, each omprised of 30 cards, were
   printed and sold for 10 cents a card.

   Not only did Mariani like to be surrounded by the rich and famous, he
   also emulated their lifestyle. His dedication to coca was evident
   everywhere. By the turn of the century, he constructed large
   greenhouses, filled with thousands of coca plants, on his estate. He
   also constructed a laboratory, a production plant, and a large art
   nouveau salon, built of elaborate glass and wrought iron. Images of
   coca plants were woven into the rugs and curtains, and even the floor
   tiles and ceiling moldings were decorated with a coca leaf motif. He
   commissioned Eugene Courbin to paint his office ceiling with an
   allegory of "The Goddess Bringing the Coca Branch to Europe." Coca
   leaves were carved into the chairs and sofas, and rooms were decorated
   with artificial coca plants in ceramic pots.

   In the final analysis, Mariani's advertising innovations were probably
   more important than his pharmaceutical or winemaking skills. Like the
   makers of Coca-Cola, Mariani never disclosed the formula for his famous
   wine, saying only that he used a "fine" Bordeaux and only "the finest
   coca leaves." Actually, the formula for coca wine was no secret. The
   French government had set guidelines for its manufacture, and any
   pharmacist could produce it. The formula was simplicity itself. Sixty
   grams of ground coca leaves were soaked for 10 hours in 1 liter (2.1
   pints) of red or white wine, containing 10% to 15% alcohol.

   master at self-promotion, and it is difficult to decide which of his
   two great inventions he should be remembered for: the popularization of
   coca wine or the invention of the modern publicity campaign. Vin
   Mariani was immensely popular. Mariani would send cases of free wine to
   celebrities, who would then write thank you notes or even endorsements
   that Mariani collected and published. Thomas Edison and Sarah Bernhardt
   wrote endorsements, as did Pope Leo, III. President William McKinley's
   secretary, John Addison Porter, wrote Mariani to thank him. Porter
   assured Mariani that the wine would be used whenever the occasion
   required. From the author's private collection.

   By modern standards, Vin Mariani did not contain very much cocaine.
   With an average cocaine content of one-quarter to one-half percent
   Bolivian leaf (the only kind of leaf available in France at the time),
   1 liter of wine would have contained as little as 150 mg, and certainly
   no more than 300 mg, of cocaine. One ounce of Mariani's tonic would
   have contained only 6 mg of cocaine, and two glasses would have
   contained less than 50 mg of cocaine, equivalent to one "line" of
   snorted cocaine. A 50 mg dose of cocaine is barely enough to produce
   measurable effects in humans.

   Mariani had competitors in England (Figure 4.3), the United States, and
   France. In 1895, a representative of the Pharmaceutical Society of Lyon
   complained to the French government when one of its generals ordered a
   supply of Vin Mariani for his troops in Madagascar. He pointed out that
   any competent pharmacist could make wines every bit as good as
   Mariani's and complained that "since the general had not found it
   necessary to specify any particular non-coca containing brands of
   Bordeaux or Champagne wine for the troops, it is equally undesirable
   that he should give one maker a monopoly of the supply of coca wine."

   Page12Page09420w569h Figure 4.5 Burnett's Cocoaine For the Hair. As
   soon as cocaine became available in sufficient quantities, snake-oil
   manufacturers started adding cocaine to all of their product lines.
   This advertisement is from a Boston newspaper published in the late
   1890s. From the author's private collection.

   The American brands of coca wine tended to contain more cocaine (4.5 to
   10.8 mg/oz) than Vin Mariani. Wyeth & Brothers produced a sherry
   containing 15.2% alcohol with 4.5 mg of cocaine per ounce, while
   Metcalf & Company, located at 39 Tremont Street in Boston, offered a
   Malaga (a kind of sherry) containing nearly 21% alcohol with 9.7 mg of
   cocaine per ounce. In contrast to Mariani's "fine Bordeaux," H. Caswell
   & Company used a generic "red wine" that contained nearly as much
   alcohol as Mariani's and one third more cocaine ( 11.5 mg) per ounce.
   In order to stay competitive, Vin Mariani exported to the United States
   was formulated to contain slightly more cocaine than the variety sold
   in France (7.2 mg/oz versus 6 mg/oz).

   Without refined cocaine to add to the wine, the only way to raise the
   wine's cocaine content was to soak more leaves in the wine. The problem
   with this approach was that other compounds, and some of them not
   particularly tasty, were extracted into the wine as well; thus, the
   higher the cocaine content, the worse the wines tasted. Commercial
   quantities of refined cocaine did not become available until the late
   1880s, about that time that U.S. versions of Vin Mariani came to
   market. They contained more cocaine than Mariani's formulation, because
   the U.S. manufacturers were adding pure cocaine to their products, not
   leaves. Eventually, though, the higher cocaine content of the American
   wines led to their own undoing, because it helped lead to the passage
   of the U.S. Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.

   Page12Page10Fig46400w542h Figure 4.6 This advertisement for a
   cocaine-containing baldness cure was published at approximately the
   same time as the advertisement for the Burnett 's product. From the
   author's private collection.

   Something similar happened in England. Pharmacists in England were
   allowed to sell coca wines tax free ("nonexcisable"), provided that the
   wines ontained so much coca leaf extract (at least 30 mg/oz) that they
   were guaranteed to taste terrible. Wines that contained lesser amounts
   of extract were considered beverages, not medications, and as such,
   were taxable. If a pharmacist wanted to sell the good-tasting wines, he
   had to purchase the equivalent of a liquor license. Enterprising
   pharmacists got around that law by elling concentrated essences to
   customers, who could then add the "essence" o their own wines. One
   popular version of "essence" contained 0.25% ocaine, while other brands
   contained up to twice as much. When added to the customer's own bottle
   of port wine, for instance, the final product would have been hard to
   tell from any of the specially brewed coca wine products.

   In later years, Mariani ridiculed competitors who simply added refined
   cocaine to wine. He maintained that other components of the leaf were
   needed for flavor and character. If not appropriately blended, it was
   not drinkable. It would be tempting to dismiss Mariani's claim as
   "spin," or marketing hyperbole, but if the history of the Coca-Cola
   Company is any indication, Mariani was probably correct. Sometime after
   1901, Coca-Cola dropped cocaine from its formula, but continued to add
   an extract of coca leaves from which the cocaine had been removed. The
   decocainized leaves, referred to as "Merchandise No.s:' were prepared
   especially for Coca-Cola at the Shaeffer Chemical Manufacturing
   Facility in Maywood, New Jersey. Presumably, these decocainized leaves
   supplied the same desirable flavoring claimed by Mariani.

   Page12Page11Fig47 Figure 4.7 Another celebrity endorsement for coca
   wine -this one from Emile Zola. From the author's private collection.

   Mariani's U.S. competitors never really tried to market the good taste
   of their versions. Instead, they made mostly medical claims, repeating
   the claims for coca leaf made by European physicians in the 1870s,
   before purified cocaine was available. Advertisements for Metcalf's
   Coca Wine were typical. Metcalf's Coca Wine sold for $1 a bottle.

   With stimulating and anodyne properties combined, Metcalf's Coca Wine
   acts without deliberating, being always uniform and therefore always
   reliable. For Athletes it is invaluable in imparting energy and
   resisting fatigue; Public Speakers and Singers find it indispensable as
   a "Voice Tonic;' because being a "tensor" of the vocal chords, it
   greatly strengthens and increases the volume of the voice; and to the
   elderly it is a dependable aphrodisiac, superior to any other drug.

   Neither Mariani nor any of his competitors could possibly have had any
   idea how or why their "anodyne" was so stimulating. More than a century
   passed before that secret was unraveled . In 1990, separate groups of
   researchers, one in Barcelona and one in Miami, discovered that the
   combination of alcohol and cocaine does more than make users feel good.
   It also produces an unusual compound called cocaethylene. When cocaine
   is consumed in the absence of alcohol, it is broken down into two
   principal metabolites: one called benzoylecgonine and one called
   ecgonine methyl ester. In humans, at least, neither of the two
   metabolites has any stimulant or psychological effects, but
   cocaethylene does. In fact, cocaethylene produces nearly as much stimu
   lation as does cocaine.

   When cocaine and alcohol are consumed together, cocaine's stimulant
   effects are enhanced and probably prolonged. Vin Mariani drinkers were,
   in effect, getting more cocaine than either Mariani or his competitors
   thought they were providing. That may explain why Vin Mariani, and the
   other cocaine-containing wines, were so popular. The discovery of
   cocaethylene also explains the puzzling observation that drinking
   relatively small amounts of coca wine seemed to cause an intense
   feeling of well-being, out of proportion to the amount of cocaine
   consumed. And it certainly could explain why the wines were so popular.

   Modern cocaine abusers, who surely would never have heard of Vin
   Mariani, still combine cocaine and alcohol. The practice can be
   explained as an exercise in empirical pharmacology; users found a way
   to get a more intense, or at least prolonged, stimulant effect for the
   same amount of money. The downside to this approach is that using
   cocaine and alcohol together appears to make cocaine more toxic, not
   just in terms of behavior, but also in terms of damage to the heart and
   blood vessels. A systematic study has never been done, but postmortem
   blood tests disclose the presence of alcohol in more than a third of
   those dying from cocaine toxicity.

   Advertising claims made by Mariani and his competitors are not nearly
   as outrageous as they seem today and should not be judged too harshly.
   The claims of the coca winemakers were entirely consistent with the
   ideas generally held by the medical community at the time. Von Liebig's
   theory of nutrition, bizarre and flawed as it was, had many adherents
   in the 1870s and 1880s. There was a general feeling, shared by
   physicians and their patients, that many ailments were the result of
   "tissue wasting” and that tissue wasting occurred when certain vital,
   but uncharacterized, compounds were absent from the diet. Von Liebig
   believed that nitrogen-containing compounds were the prime suspect. The
   fact that coca leaves contained nitrogen, albeit in small amounts, made
   them especially interesting to the medical community. Mariani died in
   1914, but his wine lived on, remaining in production until 1954, when
   its name was changed to Tonique Mariani. It no longer contained any
   cocaine, but it remained on the market until 1963.

   The Concerned Cocaine Citizens Onion website is the interwebs most
   comprehensive place to find information and reference on the substance
   known as Cocaine.

   There is quite a history with the coca plant and cocaine itself. It was
   once quite legal and easily obtained. It was the main ingredient to
   Cola Cola and Mariani Coca Wine was very popular in the same era.

   Here you will find the entire book by David Lee “Cocaine Handbook - An
   Essential Reference” in the HTML format.

   There is a section of the website dedicated to the Dangers of
   Adulterants that everyone ingest cocaine these days ought to check out.
   Does your cocaine contain levamisole?

   Chapter Seven

   Purification

   It would greatly simplify matters if illicit cocaine were sold with an
   accurate list of its contents. Since this is not the case, intuitive
   judgments must be made as to the quality of the cocaine and the nature
   of the adulterants which are present. In order to be effective,
   consumer oriented purification techniques must be general enough to
   apply under a wide range of circumstances. These procedures are not
   used to make cocaine; they are used to remove adulterants and
   impurities from cocaine that has already been made.

   Since economics is always a prime factor in applying purification
   techniques, one point should be made clear. The cost of cocaine is
   dictated by the amount of it which is present in the original purchase
   (provided that none is lost in the purification process). If a gram
   costs $100.00 and is only 50% cocaine, the actual cost of the cocaine:
   is $200 per gram. Consumers who use a purification method to remove
   adulterants frequently find the resulting purer cocaine too intense,
   and add an adulterant of their own choosing (much as someone would take
   hard liquor with soda or water) or simply use much less. The real
   difference between snorting one gram of 50% cocaine or one half gram of
   pure lies in the other 50% the contents of which can clog the nose,
   numb the brain, stiffen the muscles, or just do nothing.

   The Acetone Wash

   When cocaine burns the nose the problem may be that it has not been
   washed properly and the end of the manufacturing process. Most of the
   illicit cocaine consumed in the United States comes complete with
   excess hydrochloric acid and an overabundance of oily organic material
   like hygrine. This extra acid was added in order to speed up the
   crystallization process and force the oil out of an ether solution with
   the cocaine. The oil, which may make up as much as 50% of the
   hydrochloride weight, might otherwise remain in the ether. Once the
   crystallization is complete, the cocaine, plus oils, plus excess acid
   are collected by filtration. The ether will pass through the filter and
   the solids will remain. Much of the extra acid and some of the
   impurities could be removed at this point if fresh solvent was poured
   over the cocaine and allowed to pass through the filter: this is called
   a “wash”. Since most suppliers of illicit cocaine desire a maximum
   yield, the wash is often deleted. To further complicate matters, the
   filtered cocaine is rarely dried completely. This adds a small amount
   of weight in the form of solvent residue.

   The dangers of snorting cocaine which contains even small amounts of
   hydrochloric acid and/or ether residue should be quite obvious. These
   chemicals will not only sting the nose on contact but may well cause
   deterioration of the nasal membrane. In addition, they are likely to
   cause headaches with repeated use. Hygrine acts as a local irritant on
   the nasal membranes. While this is particularly the to the acid which
   it contains, hygiene is poorly absorbed in the nose and will remain
   long after the cocaine has dissolved. If the nose is not properly
   cleaned, membrane damage my be the result.

   It is unnecessary for the consumer to subject himself to this kind of
   humiliation. The cure is simple as the cause. All that is necessary to
   correct the problem is to complete those parts of the process which
   were omitted. Since the cocaine did not receive a final wash, it is put
   back in solvent so that this simple procedure can be properly
   performed.
   ChapterSevenImage150700x885

   The most efficient way to wash cocaine (HCl) is by decantation. This
   technique is routinely used to separate a fine wine from any sediment
   which it may contain. In washing cocaine the solvent in which the
   cocaine was crystallized is poured off. This solution is called the
   mother liquor. After decanting the mother liquor, fresh solvent is
   added to the cocaine to remove more of the impurities and excess acid.
   The fresh solvent and cocaine are swirled together and allowed to stand
   until the cocaine has settled to the bottom. The solvent on top may
   then be decanted also. Each time this procedure is done, the cocaine is
   washed.

   In the case of cocaine which has been crystallized but not washed, the
   mother liquor has already been removed. The wash procedure must begin
   by placing the cocaine in a beaker and covering it with fresh solvent.
   A small stirring rod is used to break up pieces so that the insoluble
   material (the cocaine) is of an even consistency. The entire contents
   of the beaker are swirled and covered with a watchglass. In a few
   minutes, the cocaine will settle to the bottom and the solvent with its
   soluble impurities will be on top. When all the solid particles have
   settled to the bottom, the solvent is decanted through a filter and
   collected in a separate container. Any cocaine which is accidentally
   poured off with the solvent will remain in the filter. The cocaine
   which remained in the beaker is covered with fresh solvent, swirled,
   and the entire contents poured into the filter. Once all the solvent
   has passed through the filter, a small portion of fresh solvent is
   poured over the cocaine and allowed to pass through the filter. Any
   soluble impurities which may have been trapped at the bottom of the
   filter cone will be the first to pass through the filter when this is
   done.

   This type of filtration is called gravity filtration. It is based on
   the same principle which is used to filter coffee the "Melitta way."
   When a solid is separated from a liquid by gravity filtration, there
   will always be traces of solvent which remain in the solid. These are
   removed by evaporation. To facilitate this, the filter cone containing
   the solid material is pressed between the hands in a downward motion so
   that most of the remaining solvent will be forced out the bottom. The
   trace of solvent which remains is evaporated when the filter cone,
   complete with cocaine is placed under a heat lamp to dry. The filter
   paper acts as a protective shell, preventing the cocaine from being
   exposed directly to the heat lamp.

   WARNING!

   Some of the procedures documented, especially those involving volatile
   solvents or concentrated acids and alkalis may be extremely hazardous.
   The reader is cautioned not to perform any of these procedures. The
   procedures described should only be performed under laboratory
   conditions by professional chemists operating under the authority of
   the proper government regulatory agencies.
   ChapterSevenImage152700x876
   ChapterSevenImage153700x882
   ChapterSevenImage154700x926

   The choice of solvent is a critical one which must satisfy certain
   criteria. Most important of these is that the solvent dissolve the
   impurities without dissolving the cocaine. Second, it must evaporate at
   a temperature lower than that which would melt the cocaine, and it
   should leave no residue once evaporated.

   One solvent which meets all of these criteria is acetone. Contrary to
   cocaine mythology, acetone is an excellent solvent which leaves 0.001%
   residue after evaporation. Cocaine hydrochloride is almost totally
   insoluble in acetone, but hydrochloric acid will totally dissolve.
   Hygrine hydrochloride and other organic impurities are partially
   soluble in acetone. The base forms of most drugs used to adulterate
   cocaine are very soluble in acetone. Acetone is extremely flammable but
   will not form explosive peroxides as does anhydrous diethyl ether. It
   is the peroxides which can simply explode when dried and are probably
   the cause of frequently reported and rumored "underground" laboratory
   fires.* Acetone is sold in several grades which vary in purity. It is
   important that the acetone be "chemically pure," that is, free from
   alcohol and water, both of which will dissolve cocaine.

   * Some solvents mentioned here and many solvents used routinely in
   laboratories are toxic and/or flammable (possibly explosive). Working
   with them where ventilation is inadequate creates a LIFE THREATENING
   situation. Safe use of such solvents is a complex problem which
   professional laboratories have solved; any layman using such solvents
   is risking his life.
   ChapterSevenImage156700x551

   Aside from purifying the cocaine, the acetone wash may significantly
   improve its aesthetics. It is often the impurities which obscure
   cocaine's crystalIinity.

   The acetone wash will seldom if ever lower the quality of cocaine.
   However, it does have negative aspects which should also be understood.
   First, there is bound to be a weight loss, usually 8-12%, very little
   of which will be cocaine. Second, cocaine which is washed in acetone
   cannot be consumed for at least 48 hours after it is dry. The aging
   process is critical to the taste and smell of the cocaine as well as
   the health of the consumer. Aging is even more effective when the
   cocaine is screened to a fine powder, spread out on a non-porous
   surface, and dried under heat.

   Finally, since the quality of the washed cocaine is likely to be much
   better than its predecessor, it is much easier to consume larger
   amounts in a shorter period of time. The negative effects of dirty
   cocaine often act as a deterrent to its use; when the dirt is removed,
   so is the deterrent.

   Crystallization

   In this context, crystallization is a term used to refer to the process
   of converting cocaine base to cocaine hydrochloride. This requires
   technical skills which are similar to those used to convert cocaine
   hydrochloride to cocaine base. The major difference is that the
   hydrochloride form is usually the finished product which will be sold
   on the black market. Its aesthetic and technical qualities greatly
   influence the selling price and will be the subject of close
   examination. The base, on the other hand is not the final product and
   therefore does not require the precision and sophistication necessary
   to produce a marketable item. It is a means to an end, and its
   aesthetic qualities are of little importance.

   Base made by dissolving cocaine hydrochloride in distilled water and
   slowly adding an alkali like ammonium hydroxide. This raises the pH of
   the solution sufficiently for the cocaine base to precipitate. When it
   has been determined that the precipitation is complete, the base is
   separated from the water by filtration or extraction with petroleum
   ether.

   The dry base is reconverted to the hydrochloride by dissolving it in
   ether or acetone, and adding hydrochloric acid. As the pH is lowered,
   the cocaine precipitates as cocaine hydrochloride crystals. When it has
   been determined that crystallization is complete, the crystals are
   separated from the solvents (mother liquor) by filtration.

   This, at least, is the science which by laboratory standards involves
   relatively simple procedures. The art is another story, which to the
   present day has retained its secrecy. This mystique has given power to
   those who know its secrets — power over those who lack this
   understanding. For the cocaine connoisseur, there is no denying the
   aesthetic appeal and subsequent desire created by the look of
   iridescent flakes of cocaine which when fractured reveal layered
   caverns of mother-of-pearl cocaine. The testing kits are forgotten when
   the cocaine looks like cocaine, and people who could not afford dinner
   come out of the woodwork with sufficient cash to pay for dessert. They
   call it "the kind," a rare sight even among connoisseurs.

   CRYSTALLIZATION OF COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE:

   Problems and Remedies

   INDICATION

   CAUSE

   REMEDY

   The base will not totally dissolve in the acetone.

   The base was improperly made or poorly washed. Some HCI remains.

   The base may contain a non-acetone-soluble adulterant.

   The insoluble part is removed by filtration. It may then be redissolved
   in water and converted to base.

   If insoluble in water, it is discarded.

   The acid is added and no reaction occurs.

   The chemicals are too cold; stirring is insufficient,

   Not enough acid was used to sufficiently lower the pH.

   The chemicals are warmed to room temperature. The combined solution is
   reswirled until the reaction begins.

   The pH is lowered by adding more acid.

   The final hydrochloride weight is less then the base weight.

   The base was not totally dry when dissolved in acetone and an incorrect
   weight was the result.

   The base contained an oily substance which did not precipitate with the
   cocaine.

   The base must be completely dry before crystallizing.

   The oil base is not cocaine and is allowed to remain in the mother
   liquor.

   Even in cocaine producing countries the situation is much the same.
   High quality flake cocaine has become so rare that high ranking members
   of larger cocaine organizations often have their own chemist who makes
   special batches of "the kind" for themselves and a few close
   associates. While the science is readily available to anyone who can
   read, the art is only known to a select few.

   The science of crystallization is chemistry. In order to control the
   technical and aesthetic qualities of cocaine, the artist must
   understand the factors which, when properly manipulated, will produce
   the look which is desired. As this applies to flake cocaine, the
   factors are the conditions during crystal growth and crystal drying.

   Crystal Growth

   The way that cocaine crystals grow is dependent on the characteristics
   of the base and the rate at which the pH is lowered. The more rapidly
   this change occurs, the smaller will be the resultant crystals. The
   slower the pH is changed, the larger the crystals. The artist seeks to
   avoid extreme changes whether they be slow or rapid. One gram may be
   crystallized in as little as 5 minutes or as long as 48 hours.

   The majority of the great cooks agree that the best looking flake is
   made from crystals which were all precipitated at the same time and
   then allowed to grow in size over a period of hours. The resultant
   crystals are of equal size and consistency, and so is the flake. When
   crystallization is too rapid, the crystals, while homogenous in size
   and consistency, retain impurities which dull the sparkle necessary to
   make pearl. Crystals which grow too slowly are usually the result of
   improper mixing of the acid and the base. These larger crystals, while
   brilliant in appearance, are usually unequal in size. They tend to
   retain solvents which do not “go away” when dried, and, where trapped
   acid is involved, multiple problems can occur. These include lowered
   yields and extremely acidic cocaine which can damage the nasal passage
   when snorted.
   ChapterSevenImage160700x926

   The Chemicals

   The chemicals which are used to crystallize cocaine include:
    1. The solvent in which the base is dissolved.
    2. The acid which is used to lower the pH of the base solution.
    3. The solvent which is used to dilute the acid.
    4. The solvent which is used to wash the cocaine crystals after
       crystallization is complete.

   The crystal growth will be affected by the choice of solvents and acid,
   which are used. Also, the purity of the chemicals, the temperature at
   which they are used, and the volumes of each will greatly affect the
   outcome.

   The Solvents

   While the most commonly used solvent for cocaine crystallization is
   ether, it is extremely hazardous to use. Acetone, although highly
   flammable, is not as toxic as ether and does not form explosive
   peroxides. It works well for cocaine crystallization for the same
   reasons that it is effective as a wash. The base is extremely soluble
   in acetone, the hydrochloride is not. It evaporates completely, leaving
   no residue. Its major disadvantage is that, unlike ether, acetone will
   not have a visible white reaction to the addition of acid. This can
   make it difficult to determine the proper amount of acid to use and the
   point at which crystallization is complete.

   The Acid

   The name of thc game is cocaine hydrochloride. It follows that the name
   of the acid is hydrochloric acid. When it comes as a liquid,
   hydrochloric acid can be 38% hydrogen chloride (HCl), no more. The
   remainder is water. Since the acid comprises only 1% of the total
   volume of liquid used to crystallize cocaine, this small amount of
   water is not a problem. If, however, the acid were more dilute (with
   water) it would be a different story. For this reason, full-strength
   liquid hydrochloric acid is diluted with absolute methanol or acetone,
   or both.
   ChapterSevenImage162700x895

   The amount of hydrochloric acid which is needed to neutralize a given
   base will always vary with its alkaloid content and degree of
   alkalinity. In general, base which is made by the method described in
   the "Cocaine Base Test" (see p. 110) will require 0.25 milliliters of
   concentrated hydrochloric acid per gram of base. The amount is
   critical. If too much acid is used, the reaction will happen very fast.
   If too little, the reaction will be slow, and some base will remain in
   solution. In that case, more acid has to be added to complete the
   process. This will produce a secondary growth of crystals with
   characteristics different from those already formed. There is no
   all-encompassing formula. The exact amount of acid required is
   determined by trial and error using the above figures as a rough
   estimate (starting point).

   Stirring

   What may seem to be an insignificant detail is actually a prime factor
   in the rate of crystal growth. When the dilute acid solution (A) is
   added to the base/acetone solution (B), crystallization begins. The
   rate at which A is added and the time it takes for all of A to mix with
   all of B will significantly alter the rate of crystal growth. Ideally,
   solution B is swirled in a circular motion at a rate which will allow
   all of solution A to be added before B ceases to swirl. This allows the
   acid to be evenly combined with the base before much crystal growth has
   begun. If the acid is added after the swirling has stopped, it will
   sink to the bottom before mixing with the base and crystal growth will
   begin on the bottom. The result is usually trapped acid and uneven
   growth. If, on the other hand, swirling is continuous before, during,
   and after the addition of the acid, crystallization will be too rapid.
   While the resultant hydrochloride will be homogenous, the tiny crystals
   will lack the brilliance and clarity of more slowly grown crystals.

   ChapterSevenImage170700x927

   When is Crystallization Complete?

   This is determined by trial and error. Generally an acetone
   crystallization takes 4 hours. While there may be no more visible
   precipitation, this does not necessarily mean that crystallization is
   complete. This is characteristic of acetone crystallizations. The
   initial snowstorm (visible precipitation) may last only 15-30 minutes,
   but the crystals continue to grow in size and increase in weight for
   several hours thereafter. A determination must be made to see if
   crystallization is complete. This is accomplished by swirling the
   crystals and allowing them to settle. A completed crystallization will
   result in the cocaine settling to the bottom in a matter of minutes.
   The liquid above is clear. An incomplete crystallization leaves the
   liquid on top cloudy with falling crystals. The cloudiness will persist
   until crystallization is complete. If crystallization is incomplete and
   the side of the beaker is scratched with the stirring rod it will
   result in new growth where scratched.

   Washing the Crystals

   Once it has been determined that crystallization is complete, the
   mother liquor is separated from the crystals by decanting it into a
   separate container. Then, as in the acetone wash, fresh solvent is
   added to the crystals, swirled, and allowed to settle. This is decanted
   into the same container as the mother liquor. (This is because the
   first wash or decantation is rarely 100% effective in removing all of
   the mother liquor. The second decantation removes the remainder.)
   Again, fresh solvent is added swirled, and the entire contents poured
   into the filter. The solvent is allowed to drip through before one last
   fresh portion of solvent is poured over the crystals. This completes
   the washing procedure.

   Drying the Crystals (Making An Empanada)

   In South America, crystal which is gravity filtered is dried “empanada
   style.” This involves removing the filter cone, pressing it between the
   hands, and placing the damp empanada under a heat lamp to dry. This is
   not the only simplest way of drying the crystals with a minimum of
   contamination (remember that crystals are often dried outside in the
   sun), it is also the best way to make layered flakes.

   Flakes are actually pressed crystals. If, as in an empanada, the
   crystals are pressed against one another and dried, the resultant piece
   of cocaine will have the texture of the filter paper on the outsides,
   and layers of pressed crystals (flakes) on the inside. When crystals
   are pressed or chopped, their brilliance increases. For this reason,
   the flake appears shinier than unpressed crystal. However, when the
   flake is chopped, it gets duller in appearance. In South America, where
   crystal is often dried in the sun, the filter paper acts as a
   protective shell, shielding the cocaine from dust and moisture. Sheets
   are often used instead of filter paper, and are hung on clotheslines to
   dry.

   The timing of when to remove the filter cone from the funnel, and the
   force with which it is pressed, are the factors used to control the
   appearance of the empanada with varying types of crystal growth. When
   very small crystals are involved, layering is achieved by removing the
   filter cone just before all the solvent from the last wash has passed
   through the filter. Pressing is minimized to remove solvent only. The
   crystals are already small and if pressed too hard, the inside
   structure is usually that of unlayered rock. In the case of larger
   crystals, the empanada is squeezed firmly in order to flatten out the
   crystals. Often, the empanada is pressed between a piece of glass and
   filter paper. The extra filter paper acts as a firm ground on which to
   press the glass, and also as a blotter, absorbing excess solvent. Once
   pressed, the empanada is layed flat to dry.

   It is critical that the filter paper be dry before the empanada is
   opened. Otherwise, some of the cocaine sticks to the filter paper and
   the consistency of the outside texture is imperfect. In South America,
   the empanada is allowed to stand at room temperature after the filter
   paper is dry. It is believed that continued heat after this point
   results in weight losses and overly dry cocaine. The fact is that dry
   is dry. When the weight ceases to change, the cocaine is dry.

   [25]Cocaine Wine

   Cocaine testing involves somewhat more than a knowledge of procedures.
   The tester must develop a feel for analyzing results and applying
   common sense. While the mechanics of most tests are actually quite
   simple, the interpretation of the results is much more complex.

   A practical approach to testing takes into consideration the location
   and circumstances surrounding each testing situation.* Very few buyers
   of illicit cocaine will be testing at the request of the seller, and
   seldom if ever will this be under laboratory conditions.

   Many cocaine dealers, especially those who claim to have knowledge of
   the origin or purity of the merchandise, will interpret testing as a
   lack of faith in their integrity.

   While this may in feet be the case, this interpretation does not make
   it any easier to accomplish the original intention that of testing the
   cocaine. Besides, a negative attitude towards testing docs not
   necessarily indicate dishonesty Many sellers do not have the time to
   let each gram buyer run a scries of tests, especially if it requires an
   effort on their part to comply.

   The seasoned consumer takes these factors into consideration and has
   with him the necessary materials to perform the tests in order to
   lessen the inconvenience to the seller. A small portable testing kit
   with which the consumer is familiar is used for this purpose.

   A common seller's response to a desire to test the cocaine is to offer
   a small taste as proof of its quality. A polite refusal to use the
   cocaine prior to testing should only strengthen the consumer's position
   and may well be interpreted by the seller as proof of the buyer's
   sincerity. It should be noted that consumption of cocaine prior to
   testing often effects the interpretation of the results. A cocaine
   dealer always seems more trustworthy after turning a prospective buyer
   on to a free snort, and the desire for another often hastens testing
   procedures or even eliminates them. Consumer willpower to abstain is
   important here, at least until the tests have been completed.

   *A number of chemical tests which give a color reaction with cocaine
   are available but are not included in this book. The experience of
   regular consumers is that samples usually do contain cocaine so other
   concerns become primary. Is it cut with something unpleasant (like
   quinine), and what is the percent purity? Converting a bit of the
   sample to cocaine base and weighing it gives an estimate of the percent
   purity and other tests can detect quinine the solubility tests). The
   CRC publication edited by Mule has excellent detailed discussions of
   color reaction tests; the book is currently hard to find in bookstores
   but available in many libraries.

   Let's assume that the buyer has arrived at the seller's house to
   purchase a gram of cocaine which is of unknown quality. Since the
   seller is likely to be using the same coke he is selling, the
   atmosphere surrounding him (the vibes) may provide the first indication
   of its quality. His state of mind may well tell how the same cocaine
   will affect the buyer. If, by chance, the seller is not using the same
   cocaine he is selling, this should also say something about the
   quality.

   It would be unusual for the buyer to be shown more than the gram he is
   buying or to sec the gram weighed, but should the opportunity arise,
   there are two good reasons to take advantage of it. The first thing
   looked for will be the proportion of pieces to duff (powder). How does
   this compare to that in the gram being purchased? If the seller shows a
   preference for either, it is likely that they are not the same (Most
   adulterants which are mixed in without reconstitution will be found in
   the duff.) If the seller is indiscriminate, showing no preference for
   either, it may mean that there is no difference.

   The second reason has to do with odor. A large amount of illicit
   cocaine which has not changed containers recently will give off a more
   distinguishable odor than a newly weighed gram in a paper bindle. High
   quality illicit cocaine has little odor, and a recent change of
   containers may make it falsely seem odorless.

   There are two distinguishable scents which are found in illicit
   cocaine. A sweet smell reminiscent of wintergreen is very common. Its
   presence usually indicates that some of the cocaine has decomposed.
   This odor is usually accompanied by an excess of hydrochloric acid and
   an extreme oiliness in the cocaine. A dusty or musty smell may indicate
   the presence of an abnormal amount of cocamine. This type of cocaine is
   usually more opaque in appearance with less of a tendency to form
   flake-like crystals.

   More often than not, the gram being purchased will have been
   prepackaged and preweighed. Proper etiquette calls for the consumer to
   make known his intention to test the merchandise and offer to pay for
   any cocaine used in the process. The bindle is not even opened until
   this has been made clear. If for some reason this is unacceptable to
   the seller, the buyer may suggest that the product be tested at the
   buyer’s home and returned should the quality of the weight be
   unsatisfactory.

   Sensory Examination

   A close sensory examination is not only free but often proves to be
   quite revealing and informative. The idea is to take a good look at the
   gram, paying attention to the volume, density, color and crystallinity.
   Pure cocaine is very light and fluffy: a gram will more than fill a
   standard size bindle; screened it will fill a 4-milliliter bottle.
   Denser substances, whether natural or added adulterants, will greatly
   decrease the volume. Pure cocaine hydrochloride is a very white
   crystalline substance. Its sparkle is reminiscent of diamonds. Does the
   propective gram fit this description? If not, the cause is most often
   poor refining or adulteration. Is the cocaine appealing? There can be
   no demeaning the importance of aesthetics to most connoisseurs of
   cocaine. Aesthetics (whether in cocaine, music, art, or other
   endeavors) often play an important part in the lives of discerning
   cocaine users.

   A clean, dry razor blade or knife is used to pick through the gram. If
   any sticks to the blade, the cocaine is not dry. While this does not
   necessarily indicate adulteration, moisture adds weight which is not
   cocaine. It can also make it difficult to consume.

   A small amount of powdered cocaine is placed on the index finger and
   rubbed into the skin with the thumb in a circular motion. Pure cocaine
   disappears into the skin quickly and cleanly, leaving just a trace of
   oiliness on the skin. It does not feel gritty or greasy.

   A small amount of cocaine is placed on the tip of the tongue. High
   quality cocaine has a slightly bitter, almost medicinal, taste. Numbing
   is not immediate as with synthetics and will take a few minutes to be
   felt. There is no sweetness to the taste, nor is it extremely bitter.
   The sweet taste is usually attributable to some kind of sugar cut,
   while an extremely bitter taste is usually caused by one of the less
   active alkaloids like cocamine or hygrine or one of several
   adulterants. Whatever the variation, the important thing to be
   remembered is that cocaine has almost no taste at all.

   As with all tests, the sensory examination is dependent on previous
   experience with the real thing. An estimation of quality is difficult
   without a reference point, and many consumers have never had the
   opportunity to examine high quality illicit cocaine. This chapter will
   therefore focus on thc reaction of this type of cocaine to various
   tests These results will then be compared to results of tests done on
   the same cocaine to which some common adulterants have been added.

   The Methyl Benzoate Test

   It seems logical to begin the more objective testing by confirming or
   denying the presence of cocaine. This may seem rather basic, but it has
   become more and more common to encounter supposed cocaine which
   actually has no cocaine in it whatsoever. Cocaine gives a positive test
   but is not the only chemical that does; however, a negative test means
   that no cocaine is present.

   The test is based on the principle that in the presence of a strong
   alkali and absolute methanol, cocaine will decompose and a reaction
   forming methyl benzoate will take place. A positive reaction may be
   easily recognized by the smell of wintergreen.

   To perform the test, a small amount of the cocaine is placed in a dry
   teaspoon. One drop of a mixture of absolute methanol and sodium
   hydroxide* is added to the teaspoon and allowed to cover the cocaine.
   After the methanol has evaporated and the spoon is dry, the sweet smell
   of wintergreen will be present. This test works well with even a minute
   quantity of cocaine. If the results are negative (and the test was done
   correctly) there is no point in further testing. If positive, the next
   test is done.

   *Methanol/Sodium hydroxide solution. One gram of NaOH is dissolved in
   20 milliliters absolute methanol. Kept tightly stoppered it will keep
   for months. (Sodium hydroxide is a dangerous caustic.)

   PIECES AND DUFF

   It is quite common for cocaine to be adulterated by mixing it with a
   cheap cut and putting both substances through a coarse screen. Some
   pieces of cocaine are usually left intact to make it appear as though
   it has never been touched. To check out this possibility, a sample from
   the Testing/On Location gram is placed on a coarse screen. Tapping on
   the side of the screen with a knife or similar device will cause the
   finer particles (the duff) to pass through while holding back the
   pieces. The following tests are then done to both samples to see if the
   pieces and the duff are the same.

   SOLUBILITY

   Cocaine hydrochloride will dissolve in many organic solvents, while
   many of the substances used as adulterants will not. This principle can
   be utilized to determine the amount of material which is definitely not
   cocaine. Since consuming cocaine by nasal inhalation is dependent on
   its solubility in water, this solvent is the logical place to begin.

   A gram of cocaine hydrochloride will dissolve in 0.5 milliliter of
   distilled water at room temperature. In testing an unknown sample,
   these proportions are maintained. A small amount (approximately 10
   milligrams) of cocaine is placed in a level teaspoon. One drop of very
   cold water is added so that it will run down to the center of the spoon
   where the cocaine has been placed. Pure illicit cocaine will dissolve
   immediately. Anything which does not dissolve is not cocaine
   hydrochloride.

   The same procedure outlined above is used to test the solubility of
   cocaine in methanol. Cocaine hydrochloride is totally soluble in
   methanol. Cocaine which has been adulterated with lactose, inositol,
   quinine, or mannitol will leave traces of undissolved material in the
   spoon. As with the water test, only one drop of solvent (methanol) is
   used. A large enough quantity of solvent will dissolve almost anything.

   The solubility chart shows how these principles apply to other solvents
   listed. Water and methanol are the most commonly used, but some testers
   do use others.

   Mama Coca

   Chapter One - Mama Coca


   ... coca is an integral part of the Indians' way of life, deeply
   involved with his traditions, his religion, his work and his medicine.
   To deny the use of coca to the Indians is as serious a disregard for
   human rights as would be an attempt to outlaw beer in Germany, coffee
   in the Near East or betel chewing in India. The recent attempts to
   suppress and control the use of coca can be interpreted only as the
   latest step in the white man's attempt to exterminate the Indian way of
   life and make him completely dependent on the alien society and economy
   which has gradually surrounded him.

   Richard T. Martin,

   Economic Botany, 1970

   "... certain coqueros, eighty years of age and over, and yet capable of
   such prowess as young men in the prime of life would be proud of."

   Or. Hipolito Unanuc, 1794, commenting on the aphrodisiac value of the
   coca plant (in R. T. Martin, 1970

   Coca is consumed by chewing the leaves with a pinch of lime prepared
   from calcinated seashells or plant ashes. Prior to adding the lime, the
   leaves are chewed to moisten and break them, as well as remove the
   stalks and strings. Then the lime is added pinch by pinch until the
   proper mixture is achieved. The wad of leaves is then kept relatively
   still between the teeth and cheek; it is sucked on rather than chewed.
   The amount of lime used is critical to the taste and to the
   concentration of alkaloid released. It is still a common practice for a
   mother to introduce her young to the coca experience by preparing the
   wad of leaves in her mouth and then transferring it to the mouth of her
   child. In this way, the proper amount of lime will be present in the
   first wad of leaves the child uses, which ensures that the first
   experience with coca will be a positive one. Since lime is caustic, an
   excess will burn the mouth. Without any formal knowledge of chemistry,
   these Indians were extracting the alkaloids from the leaves by making
   them alkaline. They knew that the lime was the mechanism by which
   absorption of the alkaloids could be controlled. Thus, if while chewing
   the leaves a little too much alkaloid was released, one had only to
   ease up on the lime and let the saliva wash out some of the excess lime
   into the stomach. The lower concentration of time would result in a
   slower absorption of alkaloids. Interestingly, cocaine alkaloid content
   was not the prime factor in choice of leaves. The Indians consistently
   chose leaves with a lower cocaine content but a high concentration of
   sweet, aromatic compounds which gave the wad of coca better flavor.

   Over the years South American Indians have found the leaf beneficial in
   numerous ways. Aside from its ability to clear the mind, elevate mood,
   and make energy available, it appears to exert good influences on many
   physical functions. For example, it tones and strengthens the entire
   digestive tract, probably enhancing the assimilation of foods. A hot
   water infusion of coca sweetened with a little raw sugar (called agua
   de coca) is an excellent remedy for indigestion and stomach ache that
   was widely used even by non-Indians throughout South America until
   relatively recently.

   Coca appears to maintain the teeth and gums in a good state of health;
   it keeps teeth white. The leaf is rich in vitamins, particularly
   thiamine, riboflavin, and C. An average daily dose of coca leaves (two
   ounces) supplies art Indian of the High Sierra with much of his daily
   vitamin requirement. Coca appears to have a beneficial influence on
   respiration, and is said to effect rapid cures of altitude sickness. It
   also rids the blood of toxic metabolites, especially uric acid. Indians
   say that regular use of coca promotes longevity as well. According to
   Indian tradition, coca was a gift from heaven to better the lives of
   people on earth.

   (From Andrew Weil's "The Green and The White," p. 334> The Coca Leaf
   and Cocaine Papers)

   The story of how coca and cocaine use started in Europe and North
   America is related in many ways to its traditional use by the South
   American Indians. Most early commercial products were made from the
   whole coca leaf. In Europe, Angelo Mariani produced a coca wine which
   gained wide popular acceptance. John Styth Pemberton, a pharmacist in
   Georgia, developed in 1886 a tonic soda water as a temperance drink
   (non-alcoholic) which he called Coca-Cola. Both products were sold as
   elixirs and the positive benefits to good health were their advertised
   features. A host of similar and even stronger products appeared on the
   market and the abuse of purified cocaine became a media sensation.
   Cocaine was removed from Coca-Cola in 1903, and in 1914 cocaine became
   illegal in the U.S.

   Although coca is native to Peru and Bolivia, it has been successfully
   cultivated in a variety of climates and countries including Colombia,
   Jamaica, Ecuador, Brazil, Chile, Java, Ceylon, India, France, and the
   United States. For further information on the cultivation of coca, sec
   Mama Coca by Antonil, published by Hassle Free Press (London), Chapter
   Six.

   Of the various species of coca, only two have been used as primary
   sources of cocaine, and it is these upon which we will focus.
   Erythroxylum coca, called Huanaco, is primarily cultivated on the
   eastern slopes of the Andes in Bolivia and Peru. Its greenish-colored
   leaves are elliptically shaped with parallel longitudinal lines on the
   underside of the leaf. It has a haylike odor. The plant grows well in
   altitudes between 500-1500 meters where the climate is favorably
   tropical, high in rainfall, moderate in temperature, and the soils are
   mineral rich and well drained. E. coca is the most important commercial
   species of coca and is used to make the majority of the world's
   cocaine. In Peru, the leaves from E. coca represent 95% of the total
   annual crop. As with the other varieties of coca, the alkaloid content
   is variable both in amount and composition, depending on where it is
   grown. A variety of £. coca called Ipadu or Amazonian coca is
   cultivated in the western Amazon of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This
   variety is propagated by cuttings rather than seeds, and prefers
   moderate temperatures and well-drained soils. The plant itself is
   taller and more spindly than Huanaco and has weak branches and
   relatively large elliptical leaves which are blunt or rounded at the
   apex. Its underside lacks the characteristic parallel lines. Amazonian
   coca contains very little true cocaine and is primarily used for
   chewing by the people who cultivate it.

   An advertisement for Vin Mariani, Paris, c. 1890. Angelo Mariani
   marketed this stimulating coca-leaf wine, predecessor to coca-based
   soft drinks, for physicians and fashionable connoisseurs alike. Its
   exact recipe was a closely guarded secret, but Mariani received and
   published twelve volumes of testimonials to its tonic virtues from many
   notables, including Jules Verne, Sarah Bernhardt, the Czar and Czarina
   of Russia, Thomas Edison, and Queen Victoria. Pope Leo XIII awarded
   Mariani a Gold Medal for this elixir made from the Divine Plant of the
   Incas.

   TESTIMONIAL QUOTES FROM THE MARIANI ALBUM 1884-1913:

   Thomas Alva Edison.

   "Monsieur Mariani, I take pleasure in sending you one of my photographs
   for publication in your Album. Yours very truly."

   Camille Flammarion (an astronomer who founded the French Society of
   Astronomers).

   "Solar rays in bottles."

   Charles Gounod (composer of symphonies and operas). "To my good friend
   Mariani, beneficial revealer of this admirable coca wine from Pern,
   whic h has so often restored my strength."

   Cardinal Lavigerie: "Your coca from America gave my European priests
   the strength to civilise Asia and Africa."

   Pope Leo XIII sent a gold medal to Mariani through a Cardinal with the
   following letter:

   "Rome, January z, 1898. His Holiness has deigned to commission me to
   thank the distinguished donor in His holy name, and to demonstrate His
   gratitude in a material way as well. His Holiness does me the honour of
   presenting Mr. Mariani with a gold medal containing His venerable
   coat-of-arms."

   William McKinley (President of the United States). "Executive Mansion,
   Washington, June 1+, 1898. My dear Sir, Please accept thanks on the
   President's behalf and on my own for your courtesy in sending a case of
   the celebrated Vtn Mariani, with whose tonic virtues I am already
   acquainted, and will be happy to avail myself of in the future as
   occasion may require. Very truly yours, John Addison Porter, Secretary
   to the President."

   Augttste Rodin: "To Mariani, who spreads coca. Your friend."

   Jules Verne: "Since a single bottle of Marian’s extraordinary coca wine
   guarantees a lifetime of a hundred years, I shall be obliged to live
   until the year 2700! Well, I have no objections! Yours very
   gratefully.”
   CocaPlant314w540h

   The temperature in which Coca is grown must be equable, of about 18° C.
   (64-4° F). If the mean exceeds 20° C. (68° F), the plant loses strength
   and the leaf assumes a dryness which always indicates that it is grown
   in too warm a situation, and though the leaves may be more prolific,
   they have not the delicate aroma of choice Coca.

   A peculiar earth is required for the most favorable cultivation of
   Coca, one rich in mineral matter, yet free from limestone, which is so
   detrimental that even when it is in the substratum of a vegetable soil
   the shrub grown over it will be stunted and the foliage scanty. While
   the young Coca plants may thrive best in a light, porous soil, such as
   that in the warmer valleys, the full grown shrub yields a better
   quality of leaf when grown in clay.

   This, commonly mixed with organic matter and salts from the decaying
   vegetation, or that of the trees burned to make a clearing, affords
   what might be termed a virgin earth—terra franche ou normale—which
   requires no addition of manures for invigoration. In the conservatory
   it has been found, after careful experimentation, that a mixture of
   leaf mould and sand—terre de bruyere, forms the best artificial soil
   for the Coca plant.

   Aside from an appropriate soil that is well drained, there is another
   important element to the best growth of Coca, and that is a humid
   atmosphere. Indeed, in the heart of the montana it is either hazy or
   drizzling during some portion of the day throughout the year, the
   intense glare of the tropical sun being usually masked by banks of fog,
   so that it would seem that one living here is dwelling in the clouds.

   ESSENTIALS FOR CULTIVATION OF COCA

   Erythroxylum novogranatense is native to Colombia, Venezuela, and parts
   of Central America. In Colombia, it grows in the Sierra Nevada de Santa
   Marta and in the rugged mountains of Cauca and Hucha. This species is
   highly resistant to drought and prefers a hot, dry habitat.

   It is a bushier plant than E. coca, with smaller, narrower, and thinner
   leaves which are bright yellowish green in color and rounded at the
   apex. Its leaves contain large amounts of methyl salicylate which give
   it a wintergreen odor. However, its true cocaine content is much lower
   than that of E. coca. In Colombia, where coca cultivation is illegal,
   illicit crops of E. novogranatense are cultivated for local chewing and
   for illicit cocaine manufacture. While this species has shown great
   adaptability to other climates, it has also been found that the
   alkaloid composition and quantity will vary with the climate and soil.
   An example of this is Java coca, which was adapted from E.
   novogranatense. Until World War II, this variety provided most of the
   raw materials for the worlds supply of pharmaceutical cocaine. While
   its alkaloid content is even higher in Java than in Colombia, its true
   cocaine content is much lower.

   On the desert coast of Peru and in the adjacent arid valley of the Río
   Marañón, a variety of E. novogranatense is grown. It has been named
   Trujillo after the region in Peru where it is grown. The leaves of E.
   novogranatense var. truxillense provide only 5% of Peru's annual
   harvest, and most of this is exported to the United States for use as a
   flavoring agent in Coca-Cola. The remaining leaves are locally consumed
   (chewed) by natives who value them for their great aromatic qualities
   and palatability.

   E. novogranatense var. truxillense has been cultivated in both arid and
   wet climates with great success. Its adaptability and resistance to
   drought are even greater than Colombian coca, since it actually prefers
   desert conditions. The plants are propagated by seeds and may grow as
   tall as 3 meters with multiple trunks reaching 4 centimeters in
   diameter. The leaves are narrowly elliptic to oblong, 20-65 millimeters
   long, and 10-25 millimeters wide. The topsides are medium to light
   green in color and pale green underneath. The midrib is flat with a
   slight medial ridge.

   The High Cost of Getting High

   Give cocaine to a man already wise, schooled to the world, morally
   forceful, a man of intelligence and self-control. If he be really
   master of himself, it will do him no harm. He will know it for a snare;
   he will beware of repeating such experiments as he may make; and the
   glimpse of his goal may possibly even spur him to its attainment by
   those means which God has appointed for His saints. But give it to the
   clod, to the self-indulgent, to the blasé — to the average man, in a
   word—and he is lost. He says, and his logic is perfect:This is what I
   want. He knows not, neither can he know, the true path; and the false
   path is the only one for him. There is cocaine at his need, and he
   takes it again and again. The contrast between his grub life and his
   butterfly life is too bitter for his unphilosophic soul to bear; he
   refuses to take the brimstone with the treacle..

   -Aleister Crowley, Cocaine, 1918

   There is little need to enumerate the attractive aspects of cocaine.
   The increased use of cocaine by people from every walk of life provides
   ample evidence of the existence of its positive qualities. In fact, the
   positive aspects are so distinctive that the negative aspects are often
   unrecognized, misunderstood, or ignored. Nonetheless negative aspects
   do exist, and an understanding of their nature and a practical
   knowledge of how to compensate for them should be foremost in the minds
   of all cocaine users. Since cocaine use over both short and extended
   periods can lead to many health problems, this will be discussed next.

   Cocaine and Health

   Cocaine is a stimulant of the central nervous system. It is legally
   classified as a Schedule II drug with an accepted medical use (as a
   topical anesthetic) and a high potential for abuse resulting in
   psychological dependence. The behavioral effects of cocaine vary with
   purity, dosage, and the way it is taken. The route of intake is very
   critical regarding time, e.g., shooting or base smoking vs. snorting or
   taking a pill. When "snorted" the initial effects are felt almost
   immediately with the full effects taking about 15 minutes to develop.
   The heart rate increases as does body temperature, respiratory rate,
   and blood pressure. Mental alertness increases and the appetite is
   depressed. A feeling of physical and mental well-being predominates.

   Depending on the individual, these effects may last for as little as 20
   minutes or as long as 2 hours. As the stimulative effects wear off,
   depression may set in. Blood pressure and heart rate drop to a lower
   rate than that which existed prior to ingestion. The stronger the
   initial stimulation, the more pronounced will be the "crash." In fact,
   the contrast is so great that the user is often inclined to counteract
   it by ingesting more cocaine.

   Prolonged use of cocaine can lead to many health problems. Physically,
   the chronic user may experience hyper-stimulation, headaches, nausea,
   irregular respiration, anxiety, and possibly convulsions. Over an
   extended period of time, cocaine use can lead to infections, digestive
   disorders, severe weight loss, malnutrition, and chronic insomnia. The
   user may also be faced with many psychological problems, including
   paranoid delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, and confusion
   in the decision-making process. Concentration, comprehension, and
   reaction ability may all be markedly impaired.

   While cocaine is not physically addicting, it is very habit forming.
   The term psychogenetic dependence is often used to describe this
   condition. Although there is no physical dependence resulting in
   violent physical reaction to withdrawal, the user thinks he has a
   physical need for the drug. The difference is a very fine line; if the
   consumer carried the habit to extremes, die distinction between a real
   and imagined addiction may not be too relevant, Cocaine certainly
   affects judgment as to what is real or imagined, and all consumers
   should keep this in mind.

   Periodic abstinence is by far the best means of counteracting these
   effects. In the absence of abstinence, other measures must be taken. A
   balanced diet is extremely important, and although the user may not
   feel like eating, he must force himself to eat. The first bite is the
   hardest. Cocaine use burns up energy at an extremely rapid rate, and
   energy levels must be maintained. Liquid intake is very important since
   cocaine use dehydrates the body. Taking vitamins, especially B, C and
   E, will help to counteract cocaine's tendency to deplete them. Cocaine
   is a stress-producing drug, and even occasional users find that high
   bodily levels of vitamin B complex help cope with this stress.
   FatFreddieChapter4Insert1800w1177h

   Many people find the need to balance the cocaine stimulation with some
   kind of depressant. Often, this depressant will be alcohol. This can be
   dangerous if alcohol intake is substituted for water intake. If the
   body is dehydrated, alcohol is more easily and rapidly absorbed into
   the bloodstream. In excess, this can result in alcohol poisoning. If
   the consumer insists on drinking alcohol, drinking extra liquids
   (water) can lessen the toxic effect of the alcohol.

   Cocaine overdoses have been known to occur on amounts of as little as
   0.20 gram.

   The most common method of ingesting cocaine is by inhalation. This is
   accomplished by chopping or screening the cocaine into a fine powder
   and sniffing it into die nasal passages through a straw or from a very
   small spoon. "Snorting" is a very efficient means of introducing
   cocaine into the bloodstream because the inner nose membranes arc lined
   with tiny blood vessels. Cocaine entering the nose will settle on the
   sticky walls of the mucous membranes where it will dissolve almost
   immediately. It can then be absorbed through the capillary walls, into
   the bloodstream and on to the brain.

   The cocaine totally numbs the area, and the nasal membranes shrink as
   their blood supply diminishes. Since cocaine constricts the flow of
   blood in the vein (vasoconstrictor), the mucous membranes will demand
   the blood which has been withheld as soon as the drug wears off. The
   nose soon becomes congested, and sneezing and head cold symptoms are
   likely to follow. Any cocaine which remains undissolved in the nose can
   cause burns and sores which can eventually lead to degeneration of the
   membrane or eat through the cartilage itself. This may be prevented by
   periodically cleaning the nose with some type of nasal douche. Several
   home recipes for douching arc popular, but none arc more effective than
   that used by Michael Aldrich. (See 'Tips on Health Care.") The more
   efficient the cleaning, the less the chance of nasal damage.
   Chapter4Insert2600w1036h

   The smoking of freebase cocaine is a relatively new phenomenon in the
   United States which has been rising in popularity at an alarming rate.
   "Freebase" is the alkaline form of cocaine, the alkaloid itself. When
   an alkali like ammonium hydroxide is added to a water solution of
   cocaine hydrochloride, the cocaine (base) is freed from the HC1
   molecule. It may then be separated from the water by filtration or
   extraction with a solvent like petroleum ether.* Most freebasers choose
   the extraction method because it greatly decreases the drying time
   while allowing the user to create beautiful formations of crystals.
   With cocaine aesthetics on the decline, this becomes a process which
   can bring back some visual aesthetics, increasing its appeal.

   Freebase is usually consumed in a water pipe which has been
   specifically designed for the smoking of oils. The bowl of the pipe is
   designed to accommodate multiple levels of stainless steel screens. The
   base is placed on the top screen, melted to an oil, and then heated
   slowly while air is drawn through the stem and into the mouth.
   Sometimes a rum-soaked (151 proof) burning cotton ball is used for
   heating the base. The water pipes have the smoke pass through water
   prior to entering the stem. This cools and smooths out the smoke while
   acting as a kind of filter for impurities. Often, the base is not
   heated directly. The glass bowl is heated from the side with a gas
   torch in order to minimize match or lighter fume inhalation. This also
   helps to prevent recrystallization of the base in the bowl. Where
   freebasing is done there is also usually some very flammable solvent;
   an open flame near such solvents is a potential disaster.

   A less pure base is sometimes made by dissolving the cocaine
   hydrochloride in water, making the solution alkaline (sodium
   bicarbonate is the alkali most often used), and heating the mixture
   until all the water has evaporated. The waxy base which is produced
   contains the added alkali and the same adulterants and impurities as
   did the original cocaine.
   Chapter4Insert3500w665h

   Smoking freebase cocaine in this way is strictly an American
   phenomenon. Although both pasta and base have been smoked in South
   America for years, they are much less pure forms of cocaine and are
   almost always combined with tobacco when smoked. Base is made from
   pasta (cocaine sulfate) to make crystal (cocaine hydrochloride).
   Freebase is made from crystal in order to be smoked.

   TIPS ON HEALTH CARE by Michael R. Aldrich

   Cocaine connoisseurs crush, chop, or screen the coke to a fine powder,
   and use small doses—aiming it high up inside the nasal cavity.

   Beyond that, health care consists of three simple rules. First, don't
   neglect eating, even if you're not hungry. This also means keeping your
   levels of bodily fluids up to par by drinking plenty of water or fruit
   juices (not alcohol). Cocaine—especially if you're also smoking
   marijuana—dries up the membranes on which it is placed, and also dries
   up bodily fluids generally. Without adequate food and fluids, your body
   cannot function normally. The exhaustion that most users feel after a
   cocaine run is the signal that you should let that wonderful
   machine—your body—recuperate with the basics of sleep, food, and water.

   Secondly, take your vitamins. The extra stress that cocaine causes in
   your energy and life-support systems quickly depletes your vitamin
   levels. The coca plant itself offers a clue to the vitamins and
   minerals appropriate for use with cocaine. One hundred grams of
   Erythroxy-lum coca provides more than the daily Recommended Dietary
   Allowance of vitamins A, Bi, and E, calcium, iron, and phosphorus, as
   well as a healthy complement of vitamin C, most of the B complex,
   iodine, magnesium, zinc, copper, and sodium. (Duke, Aulik, and Plowman,
   Harvard Botanical Museum Leaflets 24 (6), 1975). These arc the elements
   which must be replaced if you use cocaine.

   "Vitamin C, 1,000 mg. A.M. and P.M. (time release), is strongly
   recommended, along with a stress B complex, so mg.," says Earl
   Mindell's Vitamin Bible (Rawson, Wade, N.Y., 1979)- "A good
   multiple-vitamin and mineral tablet as well as a high-potency mineral
   taken twice daily is alio advised." If you have a sudden craving for
   peanut butter during or after a coke session, it may be a sign that
   your B vitamins are depleted. The B complex should be taken with food,
   and metabolizes rapidly, so take more than 50 mg. daily if you're doing
   a lot of cocaine. The way to gauge this is to keep your piss yellow.
   Vitamin A should be taken sparingly because it's easy to overdose
   (nausea, diarrhea, chills).

   Vitamin E, 100 to 400 IU daily, seems to help spruce up your
   cardiorespiratory system. Acting as a vasodilator and mild diuretic, it
   lowers blood pressure and helps repair damaged tissues by enriching the
   blood's oxygen supply. If you smoke anything—tobacco, marijuana, or
   freebase—take vitamin E to protect your lungs. Also be aware that
   ferrous sulfate, a form of iron often found in multiple-vitamin
   formulas, destroys vitamin E. Use a formula that contains iron as
   ferrous fumarate or gluconate. Learning to use vitamins is almost as
   tricky as learning to use drugs.

   A program of daily exercise, good diet, and vitamins will help flush
   toxic chemicals from your system and, as a bonus, will make cocaine
   more effective the next time it is consumed. But if you neglect this
   healthy regime, coke simply adds to the poisons that accumulate in your
   system, and makes you feel lower, not higher.

   Thirdly, clean your nose without fail after every coke session (not
   after every toot). The nose is the respiratory system's natural air
   conditioner. As air flows up through the nostrils and down through the
   pharynx, larynx, and trachea, it passes over mucous membranes which
   warm it. and catch foreign particles to purify it, on its way to the
   lungs. Cocaine when snorted tries to follow the same route but gets
   dissolved almost instantly on the membranes, entering the blood stream
   through the many tiny vessels of the membranes. At the same time,
   cocaine restricts these blood vessels and anesthetizes the cilia which
   keep the mucous blanket moving back over the membranes. Thus the
   membranes dry out and stop functioning, leading very quickly to
   dryness, crusting, and ulceration in your nose. Every time you take a
   toot you are turning your air conditioner off. Unless you help restore
   this necessary function, you render yourself susceptible to nagging
   colds, bacterial infections, and a host of respiratory diseases.

   There are two steps to cleaning your nose and reviving your air
   conditioner. First, make a weak saline solution in a glass with 1/4
   teaspoon salt in a cup of warm water. Pinch your thumb and forefinger
   together and pour a little of this solution over them. Raise this to
   your nostrils and sniff gently so a tepid salt spray is spread over the
   membranes inside. Alternatively, pour some into your cupped palm. Close
   one nostril and inhale through the other until water washes back into
   your throat. Change nostrils and repeat. You don't need much, and you
   don't have to go through any contortions like bending your head way
   back. Commercial nose sprays are pretty rough on nasal passages already
   irritated by cocaine, and should not be used frequently.

   Once your nasal cavity is irrigated, the second step is to lubricate it
   with vitamin E oil. A natural vitamin E "beauty oil" sold at cosmetics
   counters is okay for this if it contains only alpha-tocopherol in an
   organic medium like saflower oil.

   Or you can open up a capsule of vitamin E with a razor blade. Some
   people prefer a lanolin-petrolatum ointment of the kind used for diaper
   rash, but this is too heavy for more than occasional use in the nose.

   If your fingers are large, use a cotton swab for the application; most
   people will find this preferable. You can use the tip of your little
   finger if it's small, clean, and not jagged. Dab some E oil on the swab
   or fingertip and very carefully and slowly stick it up your nose.
   Gently wiggle it so the oil coats the membranes on all sides. Repeat
   the procedure in the same nostril, making sure that you lubricate the
   entire inner rim of the nostril and the little pocket near the tip of
   your nose. Do the same for the other side, glance in the mirror, smile
   smugly, say "next time," and go to bed. Don't worry if your nose starts
   feeling stuffy again: it's your mucous membranes beginning to revive.
   The tingling in your nose should vanish by the time you fall asleep.

   A perforated septum is more often caused by clumsy attempts to clean
   the nose than by cocaine. The nose needs time to recover from the
   irritation of any foreign substance put in it. As with cocaine itself
   douching and oiling more than every few days may harm your nose — and
   worse, your sinuses.

   If crusting in your nose continues or if you start getting nosebleeds,
   lay off the cocaine and see your doctor without delay. If you notice
   any malfunction in your system whatsoever, it could be a warning signal
   of an oncoming illness and should be checked out by a trusted
   physician. By having a checkup at the first sign of anything wrong you
   may avert a real tragedy. Paying attention is the definition of a
   connoisseur.

   -Michael R. Aldrich

   COKE AND SEX

   Since cocaine is widely used as a sex aid, a few words should be said
   about applying cocaine to the genital organs. A sprinkle of coke on the
   clitoris or just below the head of the penis will anesthetize the
   tissues and retard sexual climax. If this is done sparingly and only
   occasionally it can promote explosive orgasms. However, when cocaine
   was widely used as a surgical anesthetic around the turn of the
   century, doctors discovered that the urethra (the tube inside the penis
   or vulva through which urine is eliminated from the bladder) is very
   sensitive to cocaine: several patients died from an overdose of cocaine
   in this area. Don't apply cocaine directly to the hole in the tip of
   the penis or to the urethral opening between the clitoris and the
   vaginal orifice in the vulva. And because coke severely dries delicate
   membranes that must be moist in order to function, don't cover the
   penis with coke and don't put coke inside the vagina.

   -Michael R. Aldrich

   TREATMENT OF COCAINE OVERDOSE

   A cocaine overdose usually happens so fast that nothing can be done
   about it at home. The symptoms are: giddiness, wooziness, delirium,
   respiratory depression, Cheyne-Stokes breathing (a pattern whereby
   breathing builds deeper and deeper to a point, then becomes
   progressively shallower, with a period of no breathing between cycles),
   convulsions, and unconsciousness followed by death from respiratory
   failure. The heart may also stop. Quick action is necessary to save the
   victim's life. Stay calm, and don't let your fear of arrest prevent you
   from acting decisively.

   Have the victim lie down on his or her back with head lower than body,
   try to maintain breathing by artificial respiration, and get the victim
   to a hospital as quickly as possible no matter how embarrassed you are.
   Call an ambulance if you don't have a car. Be honest with the emergency
   room people about what drugs the analyze if complications set in.
   Cocaine is so often adulterated that the sample may be necessary to
   determine what chemicals the victim has Do not give the victim more
   drugs of any kind. There are no real antidotes to cocaine, though the
   hospital staff may administer intravenous Valium or a short-acting
   barbiturate to control seizures. The danger here is that downers may
   cause death by further depressing the cardio respiratory system. The
   best "cure" for an overdose is to make sure that it doesn't happen in
   the first place.

   -Michael R. Aldrich
   Chapter4Insert4800w299h

   The smoke which is drawn into the mouth is absorbed into the
   bloodstream through the lung tissue. This is not only the most direct
   route to the brain, it is also the most effective means of absorption.
   For this reason, individual doses of freebase tend to be smaller than
   with snorting. The effects are more quickly and strongly felt, but are
   experienced for a shorter period of time.

   The attraction of the freebase high is the initial rush, which
   subsequent tokes rarely recapture. This hardly keeps anyone from
   trying, and with the comedown in such strong contrast to the rush, an
   attempt is usually made to maintain the short-lived high by consuming
   repeated doses of increasing amounts. This often results in binges
   lasting from several hours to several days. It is very common among
   freebase users to attempt to balance the extreme high with some type of
   depressant. Once relaxed, it is even easier to consume freebase in mass
   quantities.

   There is a common misconception among freebasers that the process used
   to free the base will remove all adulterants leaving only cocaine.
   Nothing could be further from the truth. There are literally thousands
   of drugs, both synthetic and naturally occurring, which will convert to
   freebases along with cocaine. Few if any of these will produce the
   euphoria which is unique to cocaine, and a few tokes arc likely to
   produce a reaction that the user is likely to forget.
   Chapter4Insert5600w609h

   While there is an abundance of information regarding the effects of
   cocaine snorting on the nasal membranes, very little is known about the
   effects of freebase smoke on the lungs. Anyone who has used freebase
   has no doubt noticed its tendency to recrystallize in the bowl and stem
   of die pipe which is used. The question must be raised as to whether
   this recrystallization also occurs in the lungs. It is a common
   practice to clean the freebase pipe with solvent; the nose is cleaned
   with salt water. Unfortunately, one cannot apply a similar procedure on
   the lungs.

   The freebase smoker is likely to be confronted with the same
   psychological problems which face most cocaine users. However, as with
   the freebase high, they will be more quickly and strongly felt. This is
   in part due to the vast difference in purity which usually exists
   between freebase and the street coke from which it came. Pure
   substances like cocaine are generally more dangerous to consume than a
   less concentrated form. An obvious analogy is caffeine which exists as
   a small percentage of the coffee most people drink. The morning cup of
   coffee is a socially acceptable way to increase alertness, and for most
   people the side effects are minimal. On the other hand, if we were to
   consume pure caffeine by snorting or smoking it, overdosage would be
   much more likely and any side effects would be much more apparent.

   The most prevalent danger of freebase consumption is its tendency to
   totally captivate its user. Chronic users of freebase tend to do little
   else. To say that freebase is a drug which does not encourage outward
   communication would be a gross understatement. Freebasers generally use
   larger quantities of purer cocaine than with any other route of
   administration. One quarter-ounce, 7 grams, of cocaine hydrochloride
   converted to freebase is not an uncommon amount to be consumed daily
   and much larger amounts have been documented.

   The author feels a moral responsibility to especially discourage the
   use of freebase cocaine. While the old saying, "anything in
   moderation," still holds true, the use of freebase tends to encourage
   anything but moderation.

   TWO OPINIONS:

   The psychic effect of cocainum muriaticum in doses of 0.05-0.10g
   consists of exhilaration and lasting euphoria, which does not differ in
   any way from the normal euphoria of a healthy person.... One senses an
   increase of self-control and feels more vigorous and more capable of
   simply normal, and soon finds it difficult to believe that one is under
   the influence any drug at all.

   -Dr. Sigmund Freud, describing a 50 mg. oral dose. Cocaine Papers,
   18S4.

   During recent years I have seen among men of science frightful symptoms
   due to the craving for cocaine. Those who believe they can enter the
   temple of happiness through this gate of pleasure purchase their
   momentary delights at the cost of body and soul. They speedily pass
   through the gate of unhappiness into the night of the abyss.

   -Dr. Louis Lewin, 1924 quoted in R. Byck, Cocaine Papers, 1974

   The effects are strongly felt and extremely short lived. As with
   freebase, this usually leads to stronger and more frequent doses. The
   result can be damaged veins, skin abscesses, and hepatitis, in addition
   to the constant risk of overdose. The problem may be further compounded
   by the presence of impurities and/or adulterants which are usually
   present in street cocaine. Where non-water soluble substances are
   involved, the results can be fatal.

   A less common method of consuming cocaine consists of dissolving the
   hydrochloride in water or other suitable liquid and drinking it. This
   is the method Sigmund Freud himself used for consuming cocaine, but
   when taken this way most of the cocaine must pass through the stomach
   before getting into the bloodstream. Some authors think most of the
   cocaine is broken down in the stomach, while others disagree; it might
   depend on how acid the stomach is and how long it takes the cocaine to
   get through the stomach.

   Cocaine and Economics

   A consumer might think about this: coke goes for $75¬ 50 per gram, and
   $1,200-2,400 an ounce (28 grams), instead of buying one gram of cocaine
   he could:

   See 20 movies

   Buy 15 record albums

   Play 400 games of pinball, or Buy one ounce of marijuana

   The cost of two grams of coke could get him:

   15 cases of Heinekens 4 good pairs of shoes, or

   10 shares of A.T.&T.

   If the consumer does 2 grams a month he could be living in a much nicer
   apartment. Three could be a color television. Four could be a Sony
   Betamax. Seven grams could be a weekend in Hawaii. Looking at it from a
   less selfish angle, the money spent on cocaine could provide a foster
   child with milk, food, toys, medical, and dental care for an entire
   year. The consumer can have any of these tilings or get high for twenty
   minutes. (Adapted and updated from Paul Slansky, High Times Magazine,
   July 22,1977.

   Cocaine and the Law

   The fact that cocaine possession and sale is illegal has not deterred
   thousands of regular users. Very few people have had to deal with the
   legal implications of cocaine use, and most users remain unaware of the
   legal penalties which exist. Nowhere is this more true than in foreign
   countries which are visited by thousands of American tourists each
   year. While the leniency of the law may vary with circumstances and
   connections, a basic understanding and familiarity with the law should
   be clear in the minds of all cocaine users.

   The statutes listed on the following pages are subject to change; they
   are correct as of January 1,1986.

   There is considerable variation in the form of statutes from state to
   state so for details the particular state statute should be consulted.
   This table illustrates the great difference in penalties; terms range
   from 90 days to 20 years for first conviction for possession and longer
   terms for sale.

   In general the class of crime can be related to the length of term. A
   felony is a crime for which the punishment can be imprisonment for more
   than one year and a misdemeanor ranges from one day to one year. Felony
   terms are usually served in prison or penitentiary (state institution)
   and misdemeanor terms are served in city or county jails.

   In its pharmacologic action, cocaine, perhaps more than any other of
   the recognized psychoactive drugs, reinforces and boosts what we
   recognize as the highest aspirations of American initiative, energy,
   frenetic achievement, and ebullient optimism (even in the face of great
   odds). On the coin's darker side of course are exhaustion, paranoia,
   and violence.

   -G. R. Gay and D. S. Inaba (in Mule, 1976)

   Cocaine addiction differs from opiate addiction, and from alcohol and
   barbiturate addiction, in at least two respects. A cocaine user, even
   after prolonged use of large doses, docs not, if deprived of his drug,
   suffer from a dramatic withdrawal crisis like alcoholic delirium
   tremens or like the opiate withdrawal syndrome. The physical effects of
   cocaine withdrawal are minor, t his has led many authorities,
   mistakenly, to classify cocaine as a nonaddicting drug. However,
   cocaine withdrawal is characterized by a profound psychological
   manifestation— depression — for which cocaine itself appears to the
   user to be the only remedy; cocaine addiction in this respect resembles
   tobacco addiction more closely than it resembles opiate addiction or
   alcoholism. The compulsion to resume cocaine is very strong.

   -E.M. Brecher, Licit and Illicit Drugs, 1972




   Although the cocaine laws were written as if they were a tax measure
   they, like the marijuana laws, appeared to be written primarily for the
   purpose of health and morality. Yet the laws forbidding the use of
   marijuana and cocaine have been no more successful in that aim than was
   Prohibition... but as long as the laws are in conflict with widely
   accepted practices, society can expect some of its most productive
   citizens to be caught in the crossfire.

   -Editorial, Oakland Tribune, Feb. 3, 1981

   "Prolonged use of cocaine gives the nose a diffused augmentation of
   volume and a dull bluish paleness, as if made of gelatin or putty. At
   the tip of the nose there is frequently a rounded dividing line, and
   the wings of the nose are slightly swollen. The slang expression used
   by sniffers to describe the shape of such a nose compares it to the
   shape of the buttocks. Sniffers recognize each other easily in this
   way, and cocaine dealers spot prospective clients. The wings of the
   nose, which arc slightly turned up, are constantly in movement. The
   nostrils arc dilated and surrounded by a pink border about one
   millimeter wide, which gives the impression of a constantly blocked
   nose, 'astonished nose’, 'plugged nose.’”

   -Bonvicini, quoted by Leon Natanson (I936). Coca Leaf and Cocaine
   Papers 1975

   The first hit is wonderful! It's a feeling of warmth and excitement
   that starts in your chest, works up through your spine, clear up out
   the top of your head and while you're holding if the cosmos is
   spinning. It only happens once or twice and you never forget. Every
   time you do free base you are trying to recapture the unique grace of
   that first hit and it is just impossible to do so. You're wasting time
   and energy trying to recapture something you can only remember.

   -Michael Aldrieh (from an interview with Suzanne Knittel for Video
   West, 1981)


   Freebase can induce a very intense compulsive behavioral pattern of
   compulsive use- You get to the point where freebase is the only thing
   in your life. You live, die, everything for freebase and in that comes
   chronic use, lack of sleep, hallucinations, paranoia-If you have any
   kind of heart problem or are prone to any kind of heart problem, it
   certainly can freeze your heart. The freebase subculture has permeated
   every level of society. Freebase has a very debilitating effect on your
   lungs (and the passage of oxygen in your lungs).

   "SHARE A NEEDLE -KILL A FRIEND"

   A warning to needle users: don't share. Because AIDS (acquired immune
   deficiency syndrome) has a five to seven year incubation period during
   which victims do not know they have the disease, sharing needles with
   ANYONE puts you at extremely high risk of contracting this deadly
   disease.

   The AIDS virus that might be in the syringe can be killed, however, by
   cleaning the outfit with ordinary liquid bleach (5.25% sodium
   hypochlorite). Draw the bleach up into the syringe, expel it, and
   repeat with bleach. Then do the same thing twice with water, and the
   needle will be clean.

   -Michael R. Aldrich

   -Editorial, Oakland Tribune, Feb. 3, 1981

   There is no such thing as a "bad" drug. People can abuse almost any
   chemical substance ever invented. Some substances are, however, more
   subject to abuse than others. For example, although the phenothiazine
   drugs are central nervous system depressants, they arc rarely, if ever,
   abused; they do not cause a euphoria. On the other hand, central
   nervous system stimulants such as caffeine, cocaine and amphetamine,
   and depressants such as barbiturates and alcohol, arc frequently
   abused; they cause euphoria. Our society has chosen alcohol, caffeine
   and nicotine as euphoriants— though the alcoholic psychoses are
   certainly not innocuous. We choose our poisons on the basis of
   tradition, not pharmacology. Societal attitudes determine which drugs
   are accepted and the extent to which moral qualities are ascribed to
   chemicals.

   -Dr. Robert Byck, Cocaine Papers, 1974

   Heavy cocaine users report a sense that things are crawling on or under
   their skin—the so-called "cocaine bugs" phenomenon. "But these are
   pseudo-hallucinations," says Siegel. 'The patients always say it's as
   if there were bugs under their skin. They don't act on a belief that
   there actually are."

   Freebase, on the other hand, can stimulate frighteningly real
   hallucinations. One man in a group of cocaine users Siegel has studied
   for five years went through four and a quarter ounces of freebase in
   three days. He became convinced he could see "black antibodies" in his
   muscle tissue forcing dangerous white worms out of his skin. He
   examined the antibodies and worms with a thirty-power microscope and,
   with a needle and tweezers, began removing the "worms" from his flesh
   and put them in vials for documentation. He brought Siegel ten vials of
   "worms." There was nothing in the vials but dried human tissue. This
   was a genuine paranoid hallucination, and the man's girlfriend, who had
   only smoked three-quarters of an ounce of freebase over the same
   period, was seeing the worms, too.

   -Charles Perry, Rolling Stone, 1980

   How do people like this producer afford the thousands of dollars
   necessary to keep performers supplied with coke? The simplest way is to
   add the expense to the cost of the production. "Money for drugs is
   always there. You hide it in the budget under 'miscellaneous' or 'food'
   or 'entertainment'."

   Another producer disclosed his technique: "I hide it under 'props’ in
   the checks?" One studio head joked about his creative bookkeeping.
   "There are three above-the-line, cocaine-line,” he said.

   Adulterants

   Some people argue that cocaine cut with relatively harmless materials
   is safer to use than pure cocaine. This is a myth based on either (a)
   the belief that cocaine is a highly toxic, physiologically addictive
   drug, or (b) the notion that the effects of the pure cocaine are too
   powerful for most people to handle. Neither claim has any basis in
   fact. Except in very large does, cocaine is rapidly detoxified by the
   liver and it is a mild euphoric stimulant, not a powerful one.

   -Richard Ashley, High Times 1979

   As the price of illicit cocaine continues to rise, it becomes
   increasingly likely that one or more persons in the trade hierarchy
   will attempt to increase his profits by cutting the cocaine with a
   substance of lesser value. Although it is the consumer who will
   ultimately be cheated, he may often encourage adulteration by failing
   to set and maintain a qualitative standard by which to judge each
   purchase. In fact, cocaine is often adulterated in order to lower the
   selling price in accordance with buyer criteria. Many unaware consumers
   stubbornly cling to the belief that a $100 gram which is 50% adulterant
   is a better value than a $150 gram which is untouched.

   These days it is extremely rare for illicit cocaine to reach the United
   States in pure, unadulterated form. This is often due to intentional
   deletion of steps in the refining process, steps which could decrease
   the yield by eliminating organic impurities. The result is a higher
   yield of cruder cocaine base which rarely exceeds 50% in purity. While
   is unadulterated, it is still very far from pure.

   When this crude cocaine is converted to the hydrochloride form, the
   processor will often add an extreme excess of hydrochloric acid in
   order to speed up the reaction and maintain a high yield. The extra
   acid often results in some decomposition of the cocaine molecule into
   benzoylecgonine and ecgonine. This may be easily detected by the odor
   of wintergreen caused by the formation of methyl benzoate from the
   decomposition products.

   Adulteration at the source is accomplished by several means in addition
   to forcing a maximum yield from the leaves. There do exist fields of
   coca which were formerly considered worthless for cocaine production
   due to the virtual nonexistence of cocaine in the leaves. However, base
   made from these leaves may be combined with "good base" in order to
   increase the weight.

   Synthetic local anesthetics, especially lidocaine, may be obtained over
   the counter in Venezuela and Colombia. When lidocaine is added during
   crystallization, and its amount limited to 25% or less, it is very
   difficult to detect. Of course, once a 25% cut is successful, the
   amount is likely to increase in proportion to the greed which motivates
   it. While other synthetic local anesthetics arc often found in illicit
   cocaine, only lidocainc is readily available in South America, It is
   therefore logical to assume that a lidocaine cut was added close to the
   source whereas other synthetics may have been added a little closer to
   home.

   Once the cocaine has reached the United States, it becomes impossible
   to increase the weight by forcing a higher yield from the leaves. The
   cocaine is now in the hands of salesmen to whom adulteration may be the
   only means of increasing the profits. In order to accomplish this, the
   cocaine and an appropriate adulterant may be reduced to liquids,
   combined, and reconstituted together in solid form. Often, this is done
   with some form of mannitol, a mild baby laxative which is probably the
   most common cut used in the United States. Mannitol ("Mannite") is a
   white crystalline powder which is cheap and easy to get. As "the
   accepted cocaine cut," it has been advertised in several paraphernalia
   trade magazines and sold in "head shops." It is by far the least
   harmful of the more common adulterants in terms of its toxicity and its
   effect on the cocaine. Regardless of its benign qualities, to be sold
   mannitol as cocaine is to be cheated.

   Lactose and sucrose arc two sugars which are found in adulterated
   cocaine almost as often as mannitol. They are quite easily obtained,
   very inexpensive, and relatively harmless. They will, however, dull the
   appearance of the cocaine, cause post-nasal drip, and crust up the
   nose.

   Inositol is a B vitamin which is sold in health food stores. It is a
   relatively harmless substance when consumed knowingly, but as a cocaine
   cut it may be extremely irritating to the nasal passages. It is also
   very easy to detect in most of the tests outlined in the testing
   section. Inositol is sold as a white crystalline powder or as
   needle-shaped crystals.

   Caffeine is becoming the most widely used stimulant to adulterate
   cocaine. It is sold over the counter at chemical supply stores and
   comes as a small percentage of the ingredients in stimulants like "No
   Doz." Caffeine, like cocaine, is an alkaloid. It is to coffee what
   cocaine is to coca. Unlike cocaine, however, caffeine clogs up the nose
   and irritates the nasal membranes.

   Amphetamine or "speed" is a stimulant less commonly used to adulterate
   cocaine. It is much stronger than caffeine and is usually used to
   restore the buzz to overly adulterated cocaine. Speed is actually quite
   popular in its own right, but it is not cocaine, and can be purchased
   as speed for half the price.

   Quinine, though one of the most detrimental of all cocaine cuts, is
   still widely used. Quinine can produce a reaction in the body quite
   separate from cocaine. The mood may become somewhat depressed. It can
   cause ringing in the ears, impaired vision, and can lead to nausea and
   headache. Its effect on the nasal membranes can be severe irritation
   from frequent use. Quinine is often used to adulterate heroin, and can
   be fatal when injected or even snorted.
   Chapter5Img01600w768h

   FREQUENCY OF APPEARANCE OF ADULTERANTS IN COCAINE

   Of 251 samples, 81 were not adulterate (approx. 68% were adulterated).

   (Data from PharmChem Laboratories, Samples sold in the U.S. As pure
   cocaine during January and February 1981.)

   Most people don't know what they're blowing anyway— they know what
   they've been buying. You offer them pure and they won't meet your
   price—they say it's shit because it doesn't look like what they're used
   to. So you hit it with some borax and they pay your price. But that
   takes time. After you unload most of it at an honest price, then you
   can fuck around with what's left for the sucker trade.

   -Moses Wellfleet, coke dealer, in R. Sabbag, Snow Blind, 1976

   The most common of the active adulterants are the synthetic local
   anesthetics. These include but are not limited to lidocaine, procaine,
   tetracaine, benzocaine and butacaine. Since cocaine is also a local
   anesthetic, these synthetics will simulate some of the effects of
   cocaine and arc available at a much lower price. When properly
   combined, cocaine cut with a synthetic can be very difficult to detect
   by any street test, and just as difficult to remove using simple
   purification techniques. One of the most discernable differences
   between cocaine and lidocaine, for example, is that lidocaine docs not
   produce euphoria. Cocaine alone possesses this quality. Lidocaine has a
   more pronounced bitter taste, producing almost immediate numbing and
   lasting longer than cocaine anesthesia. While only tetracaine is of
   higher toxicity than cocaine, all of the synthetics will produce a
   state of mind which is somewhat hazy as compared to the clarity of
   cocaine.

   The adulterants listed above arc by far the most common.* However,
   there arc very few substances which have not been used to adulterate
   cocaine at one time or another. The consumer can best protect himself
   by having a sound knowledge of cocaine, applying varied testing
   procedures, and above all, using common sense. If the consumer is aware
   of the reaction of cocaine to tests and upon ingestion, it will be
   logical to assume that an unknown reaction is caused by an adulterant.

   *Phenylpropanolamine is a compound which is increasing in popularity as
   an adulterant for cocaine. In early 1981 it was the fourth most
   frequently identified adulterant, according to Pharm Chem Laboratories.
   It is the main ingredient in many non-prescription diet pills and
   overdoses can produce nervousness, sleeplessness, and dizziness. The
   melting point of the hydrochloride is 190-194 ℃, the base 101-101.5 ℃,
   for cocaine these values are 195° and 98 ℃, so if only the melting
   point above were considered, it could pass for cocaine. This is another
   example of the value of using a number of tests on a sample.

   Chapter Six

   Testing

   This chapter is broken down into three sections because of its height

   [1]Part [2]One

   [3]Part [4]Three

   Clorox II—A Revised Look at the Clorox Test

   The idea behind the clorox* test is that adulterants in cocaine behave
   differently from cocaine when a pinch of the sample is sprinkled on the
   surface of a glass of laundry bleach. There was no test outlined in the
   Cocaine Consumer's Handbook which received greater attention or was the
   subject of more controversy than the clorox test. In fact, the
   publicity it received probably did more to call attention to the need
   for cocaine testing than any other single factor. History may well
   remember the clorox test as the major impetus towards cleaning up a
   very black market.

   *The name "clorox test" has only a historical connection to the brand
   name. The standard composition of laundry bleach is 5.15% (by weight)
   sodium hypochlorite and any such solution can be used to do the test.
   The name "clorox test" became the accepted street term in the late
   1960s.

   The increase in public awareness about cocaine brings with it the need
   for more reliable means of testing. Whereas, in 1976, the clorox test
   could give the consumer a reasonable idea of the quality of an unknown
   sample of street cocaine, in 1980 the same test cannot even guarantee
   that cocaine is present. One must understand that in a progressive
   market like cocaine, dealer awareness keeps pace with consumer
   awareness. If the consumer finds a new test, the dealer must use a cut
   which will fool the test. The clorox test may be very effective in
   detecting a cut which is just mixed in as a powder but ineffective if
   the same cut is introduced in some step of making the cocaine
   hydrochloride.

   The nature of illicit cocaine has changed in the past 5 years. Illicit
   cocaine is seldom refined to the extent that it once was. The
   additional weight created by the lack of refinement has in some cases
   replaced adulteration. At least at the source, it is more common for
   larger shipments of cocaine to be uncut—but unrefined also. It is this
   lack of refinement which often fools the clorox test. The hygrine oil
   which has become a component part of illicit cocaine will cause the
   sample dropped in clorox to hesitate on the surface even longer than
   would pure cocaine. The result is an excellent looking clorox test
   which may not reflect the true quality of the cocaine.

   Although the reliability of the clorox test has diminished for these
   reasons, there is still a lot of street cocaine which contains the same
   sugars and/or local anesthetics which are so plainly visible in clorox.
   If for this reason alone, the clorox test is still well worth the time
   for the majority of consumers.*

   To perform the clorox test, a tall clear glass is filled with fresh
   clorox which is at room temperature. The bleach is allowed to stand
   until the liquid is motionless. A clean knife or razor blade is used to
   drop a small sample of thc cocaine on the top of the clorox. The
   results are observed.

   *For example a commercial product (TOOT, the Heavenly Incense) is being
   used by many as a cocaine substitute and will probably appear as a cut.
   When TOOT is dropped on bleach it remains on the surface and turns
   pink; with time, the color darkens to orange and then red* According to
   Pharm Chem, TOOT contains benzocaine, caffeine, and
   phenylpropanolamine.

   The Melting Point Test

   The purpose of the melting point test is to identify an unknown
   substance and determine its purity. This is accomplished by heating the
   material and noting both the temperature at which it begins to change
   from a solid to a liquid and the temperature which is reached at the
   time that change is complete. These figures are then compared to those
   known substances. Since the melting point of a solid is easily
   determined and requires minimal use of cocaine, it is the criterion
   most often used for estimation of purity.

   Unlike the boiling point of a liquid, the melting point of a solid is
   unaffected by changes in barometric pressure. It will, however, be
   affected by the moisture content of the cocaine, the degree to which it
   has been refined, impurities and adulterants which arc present, and the
   technical skills and objectivity of the person performing the test, The
   simplest way to determine the melting point of a solid like cocaine is
   to observe a sample in a glass capillary tube as it is slowly heated.
   The first step is to load a dry, finely chopped sample into the open
   end of a thin-walled capillary tube. The capillary is repeatedly
   dropped through a straw with the closed end down in order to minimize
   air pockets while tightly packing the cocaine. The capillary is then
   attached to a thermometer with the bottom of the closed end of the
   capillary even with the bottom of the thermometer. The two may then be
   suspended in an oil bath which can be heated evenly and slowly.

   If the melting point of a substance is known, the temperature may be
   raised rapidly until just before the melting temperature is reached;
   then, the rate of temperature increase is slowed down to one degree per
   minute. Since the melting point of illicit cocaine is so varied, the
   temperature is raised by 10 degrees a minute until the oil is 160° C
   The rate of increase is then slowed down to one degree per minute until
   the melt is complete. If any melting takes place below 160° C, the test
   is repeated with the rate of increase slowed down before any melting
   has begun.

   Pharmaceutical cocaine hydrochloride, which has no other alkaloids,
   will melt between 195-197° C. There will be no capillary reaction below
   190° C.

   Uncut illicit cocaine hydrochloride (made from leaves of E. coca) will
   melt between 187-192° C. The presence of minute impurities may lower
   the temperature by a few degrees, but there should be no melting below
   185° C.

   Uncut Potpourri cocaine hydrochloride (made from leaves of varied
   origin) often has several other alkaloids present with melting points
   around 180° C The melt will vary from 180-186° C, depending on the
   amount of other alkaloids which are present. There should not be any
   reaction below 180° C.

   Very few consumers will be able to obtain cocaine which will melt in
   this way. The majority of uncut illicit cocaine will have impurities
   that will lower the melting point to approximately 180° C. The lower
   melting point and wider spread (three to five degrees) usually occurs
   with cocaine which has some discoloration, a distinguishable odor, and
   an oily consistency. A similar melting point with cocaine which does
   not have these physical characteristics is usually indicative of
   adulteration. Often, a cut is added in such a way as to indicate
   superficially that only one substance is present. The absence of odor
   or discoloration is the tip-off that the lower melting temperature and
   wider spread has been caused by something other than lack of
   refinement.

   Although many commercial melting point kits have been developed
   specifically for testing cocaine, none are more accurate than the
   simple capillary, oil bath system. The needed equipment can be
   purchased at any scientific supply company and includes the following
   items:

   1 - 250° C. thermometer, 360 mm in length

   2 - Asbestos-sleeved burette clamp, with round jaws, medium size

   3 - Capillary tubes, one end closed, inside diameter, 0.9-1.1 mm,
   length 90 mm

   4 - Alcohol burner and alcohol

   5 - Melting point tube (Thiele)

   6 - Rubber stopper

   7 - Mineral oil

   8 - Several small, thick rubber bands

   9 - Laboratory stand (optional)

   Many people will prefer the ease of operation offered by the commercial
   electric melt systems. The systems which are accurate enough for
   meaningful tests all have the following features:

   1 - The thermometer is readable at temperatures between 60° C. and 200°
   C.

   2 - The thermometer and sample arc in close enough proximity to each
   other to guarantee that they are at the same temperature.

   3 - The rate of temperature increase is adjustable, the finer the
   control, the better.

   4 - Two samples can be tested at the same time. The thermometer is
   replaceable.

   5 - The view of the thermometer and sample is not obscured. A magnified
   view is preferable.

   The Concerned Cocaine Citizens Onion website is the interwebs most
   comprehensive place to find information and reference on the substance
   known as Cocaine.

   There is quite a history with the coca plant and cocaine itself. It was
   once quite legal and easily obtained. It was the main ingredient to
   Cola Cola and Mariani Coca Wine was very popular in the same era.

   Here you will find the entire book by David Lee “Cocaine Handbook - An
   Essential Reference” in the HTML format.

   There is a section of the website dedicated to the Dangers of
   Adulterants that everyone ingest cocaine these days ought to check out.
   Does your cocaine contain levamisole?

   This website is being hosted by the fine folks at the Acropolis Market
   & Forum. All donations that go into the Tip Jar will go directly to the
   DNM Avengers Donation Wallet.

   The Concerned Cocaine Citizens Onion website is the interwebs most
   comprehensive place to find information and reference on the substance
   known as Cocaine.

   There is quite a history with the coca plant and cocaine itself. It was
   once quite legal and easily obtained. It was the main ingredient to
   Cola Cola and Mariani Coca Wine was very popular in the same era.

   Here you will find the entire book by David Lee “Cocaine Handbook - An
   Essential Reference” in the HTML format.

   There is a section of the website dedicated to the Dangers of
   Adulterants that everyone ingest cocaine these days ought to check out.
   Does your cocaine contain levamisole?

   This website is being hosted by the fine folks at the Acropolis Market

   Getting Off

   Times have changed since the first edition. There is new evidence that
   cocaine damages the heart and interferes with nerve transmission in the
   brain, indicating the danger of even low-level cocaine use. Hundreds of
   users are calling treatment programs every day.

   In the context of today's “War on Drugs,” media crusading, a "crack"
   crisis (see Appendix D), a national AIDS epidemic, drug testing, police
   crackdowns, and children turning in parents, its a lot more dangerous
   to use cocaine these days.

   David Lee wrote this hook in a spirit of consumer protection, trying to
   educate users about how to minimize risks. In that same spirit, I offer
   this advice: if you believe in the intelligent use of drugs, now is the
   time to get off cocaine.

   If you have followed the health tips in this book and have contained
   your habit within manageable limits, you are in the best position to
   get off. You can do it yourself.

   The time to get off is BEFORE you have a major life-threatening
   dependency, when you still have the will power, resources and
   self-respect to say no.

   Start by cutting your habit in half: rake one line instead of two, or
   half a gram in the time you used to consume one gram. This strengthens
   your will power and lets you regain control.

   If you are very strong, the next step is to teach yourself to say no
   when cocaine is available. This is done in private by choosing an
   activity for which you usually like a toot, and doing it without raking
   a toot even though you still have some.

   Hard? You bet. As your nervous system readjusts to life without coke,
   the greatest temptation is to have just one toot to fell better. Don't
   do it, and it gets progressively easier to say no. Flush your stash if
   the temptation gets too great.

   If you can do this for two weeks, you will clear cocaine completely out
   of your system. Expect to feel chemically pissed off: don't take it out
   on your loved ones. A good diet, vitamins (especially B-complex),
   exercise, and sleep will help.

   Bv doing this in private, you prepare yourself for turning down a toot
   when it's offered to you at a party. Amazingly, you find that you don't
   really want one. You look at your ashy-faced, over-amped friends and
   say, "No thanks."

   The hardest part is re-aligning your friendships. Some of your old
   friends will stop inviting you over, interpreting your disdain for the
   drug as disdain for them. You will lose some friends: it's the price
   you pay for regaining your own life. Your real friends will be
   supportive.

   If votive tried, but still are unable to get off by yourself, no blame.
   Call one of the hotines or treatment programs in your area (see
   Appendix C), and take their advice.

   The key to getting off any drug is to figure out what you really want
   to do with your life. Read Aleister Crowley's novel, “Diary of A Drug
   Fiend” (1922), available in paperback. And remember, the ability to say
   no is the mark of the connoisseur.

   INTRODUCTION

   by Michael R. Aldrich, Ph.D.

   The life of a drug taker can be a happy one, or it can be one of
   suffering and misery: it depends on the user's knowledge.

   -James Lee, Underworld of the East, 1935


   Cocaine is a dangerous drug. It is not marijuana. Cocaine has its own
   karma of mental and physical effects: improperly used, it can lead to
   severe nose, heart, and respiratory problems. It can cause sudden
   death. Whether these sobering realities occur or not is up to the user.
   The drug itself can t decide whether it will be used well or badly, and
   the drug doesn't care.

   Moreover, cocaine is perhaps the most "positively reinforcing" of
   drugs. Lab monkeys will kill themselves trying to get it. The
   difference between a monkey and a human in this regard is that the
   human can be very discriminating about what gets put into his or her
   system. First by asking questions, then by making subtle distinctions
   and choices, the human can become a connoisseur.

   Connoisseurship means paying attention. Connoisseurship is a yoga of
   personal health care, will power, and moral responsibility. This is
   more than just status-seeking, and much more than the ability to
   identify different products or perform simple tests of product purity.
   Ultimately, connoisseurship means saving your own life.

   The purpose of this book is consumer protection, which begins with
   quality control. In 1978, the U.S. government estimated that 6.5
   million Americans had tried cocaine, and that number has probably
   tripled by now. But most consumers have never seen real cocaine.

   Pure cocaine is the Holy Grail. It sparkles like the snow. It goes in
   easy in the nose. It doesn't burn. Soon you feel no pain. That's sweet
   cocaine.

   Pure cocaine, in its water-soluble hydrochloride (salt) form, is much
   easier on the nose than the adulterants, other coca alkaloids, and
   residues of acids and solvents that usually accompany it in the illicit
   market. To begin the process of caring for your only nose, search for
   the pedigree: a lineage of growers, refiners, importers, and dealers
   who would rather raise the price than cut the product. Unfortunately,
   such a pedigree is very hard to find. Even dealers cannot often get
   unadulterated cocaine. So finally, even in the best of worlds, the
   consumer is on his own. Hence the need for this book.

   Alchemy lives! In this audacious new volume, David Lee has corrected,
   revised, and added much new information to his Cocaine Consumer's
   Handbook (And/Or Press, 1976). David devoted the last three years of
   his life to checking and re-checking these procedures, and died of
   cancer before the new edition went to press. Because of his efforts,
   the secrets of cocaine alchemy are now revealed for the first time in
   public print. How to test a sample for adulterants and impurities; how
   to remove them; how to transform street grit into pearl. Such detailed
   technical information is the sine qua non of cocaine connoisseurship,
   and is David Lee's legacy to the world.

   However, the warning at the beginning of this book is no joke: all
   procedures involving flammable substances, especially volatile solvents
   like ether and acetone, should be done only by a skilled chemist in a
   real laboratory. The finest, purest cocaine is worthless if you're not
   around to enjoy it.

   Understanding the alchemy that produces cocaine is just the beginning
   of connoisseurship. Ironically, most consumers don't like pure cocaine
   it's "too strong" and causes teeth-grinding wiredness unless incredibly
   small doses are used. The ideal natural dose of cocaine is that
   delivered by chewing coca leaves a tiny amount released slowly and
   steadily into the system along with a nice complement of vitamins and
   minerals. If someone is not getting off on one or two half-inch (5
   milligram) lines, the coke is cut and sniffing more simply means
   sniffing more cut. With uncut cocaine, the optimal dose is at least
   half and perhaps one-fourth the size of a usual line. In these
   circumstances, laying out tiny little tines is a source of pride, not
   of embarrassment. It says, in effect, that it's the real thing.

   The key to successful cocaine use is to USE IT LESS THAN YOU WANT TO.
   Put another way, "moderation in all things" is the way to protect
   oneself against cocaine abuse. This takes real will power, which begins
   by turning down a pretty white powder when one knows it's been cut to
   smithereens, and by using uncut cocaine unbelievably sparingly.
   Eventually, as David Lee points out, if consumers refuse to buy or use
   adulterated cocaine, dealers will be forced to offer a cleaner product.
   Connoisseurship is the only real leverage a consumer has in the illicit
   market. If enough consumers become connoisseurs and maintain high
   standards of quality in their purchases, this will ripple all the way
   back through the market to South American cocales and refineries where
   cocaine is first manufactured.

   The natives of Andean America long ago discovered that cocaine (in
   coca) is helpful when working or traveling at high altitudes where
   oxygen pressure is low. In tiny doses, it stimulates the central
   nervous system, especially the electrical activity of the brain and the
   cardiovascular and respiratory systems, without damaging bodily
   tissues." It increases the metabolism enough to ward off the extreme
   exhaustion and nausea (mountain sickness) that people feel when
   deprived of oxygen. When pure cocaine hydrochloride, instead of coca,
   is used at altitudes below about 12,000 feet, the drug instantly boosts
   all bodily systems just as it would at high altitude. This is the
   source of the euphoria and increased vigor that users desire

   This additional energy is rarely expended by contemporary cocainists
   who use it as a party drug rather than a work drug. Here the energy is
   cycled even faster with big doses repeated fairly frequently. It builds
   up rapidly until it peaks, which is the state sought by users. After
   that the energy drains away until the consumer has a strong
   urgesometimes an "uncontrollable" craving for another hit. This
   mini-cycle of reward and sag, reward and sag, constantly reinforces the
   user's desire for more. "Psychological dependency" is the moral trick,
   the sudden curve at the end of the tunnel of rewards. Self control is
   the only way to break the cycle. The ability to say NO is the mark of
   the real connoisseur.

   In the excitement of sweet cocaine, people tend to ignore the signals
   of stress that their body is giving them. The reward-and-sag cycle
   leads to increased doses and more frequent use of the drug. Tolerance
   builds up. To recapture the unique grace of a first hit, users snort
   more and more, or turn to injecting it or smoking freebase. When the
   party's over and they can't get to sleep, they drink alcohol, take a
   downer, or smoke a lot of weed. In the morning they feel utterly
   crummy, and reach for another hit to start the cycle again.

   If cocaine is used in this manner for days, weeks, or months, all the
   systems involved in the energy boost are severely stressed and often
   damaged. The chronic coke sniffer is an easy prey for bacterial
   infections in the nose and throat because the proper flow of mucus on
   these vital membranes is disrupted. Cocaine is a strong
   vasoconstrictor: it constricts the blood vessels which supply oxygen to
   living tissues such as the septum. This causes an ulcer which may wear
   right through and perforate the cartilage. Not just cuts, but cocaine
   itself damages the nose when snorted: lidocaine, procaine, and caffeine
   are even worse.

   Moreover, the cardiovascular system is stressed and may suddenly
   malfunction, causing a heart attack. Smoking freebase is especially
   dangerous in this respect. Cocaine increases the heart rate and blood
   pressure, so people with heart problems or high blood pressure should
   not use cocaine at all. Finally, cocaine acts locally as an anesthetic
   by blocking nerve transmission, and simultaneously over-stimulates the
   sympathetic nervous system; synaptic messages get garbled or not sent,
   resulting in anxiety, paranoia, poor judgment, and tactile (rarely
   visual) hallucinations. While the brain is frenzied, the nerves and
   muscles controlling the heart and lungs may be anesthetized and these
   vital organs simply stop functioning. In an overdose situation, which
   usually happens so fast that nothing can be done about it at home,
   delirium, respiratory depression, gasping for air, convulsions, and
   unconsciousness followed by death from respiratory failure may result.
   This is the wrong way to use cocaine.

   A less harmful way for the consumer to use cocaine is to pay close
   attention to his body and mind, his pocketbook and his product. Real
   cocaine is preferable to cuts. The user should buy less than he can
   afford. If there is any reason to suspect that coke is not pure, it can
   be tested or sent to a lab. Drug Enforcement Administration rules
   prevent drug analysis labs from revealing the percentage of purity of a
   sample, but they can state what other chemicals are in it. Impurities
   can be removed first; then the cocaine can be diluted with a relatively
   harmless adulterant like mannitol. At least the user will then know
   exactly what he's putting into his system.

   Don't snort freebase, it's not water soluble and will just act like a
   clod of dirt in your nose. I share David Lee's aversion to freebase
   smoking and don't recommend it to anybody. Though the first hit can be
   quite a rush, that feeling is impossible to recapture in succeeding
   hits, and the danger of overdose is ever-present. The same applies to
   injecting it. Injecting street cocaine is absolutely crazy imagine
   putting quinine, talcum powder, or borax in your heart and brain.
   Smoking freebase is as dangerous as injecting the hydrochloride. A
   substance when smoked enters the brain more rapidly than an injected
   substance; and the blood flow dilutes an injected dose as it
   circulates, while a smoked dose is less diluted. Smoking freebase and
   injecting the hydrochloride are the worst alternatives to snorting in
   terms of health. A user whose nose is worn out can switch to tooting
   under the tongue or dissolving a pinch of coke in a glass of wine and
   drinking it. Though the effects of oral ingestion are somewhat
   different, the high can be quite superior.

   When working behind cocaine, connoisseurs do it no more than three
   times a day, to build up a gentle plateau of stimulation like that
   provided by coca. Personally, I find a cup of coffee in the morning and
   another in the early afternoon a much better stimulus for work.

   Connoisseurs who party with cocaine treat it like a guest a temporary
   visitor, not a resident. They become consciously aware of how much it
   takes to get them high this varies with individuals and stop there.
   They recognize the excitement of sweet cocaine and take it easy. They
   aren't greedy, and don't show off about how much they can toot. Soon
   they'll discover what level is optimum for them, and how to maintain
   that level with progressively smaller, not larger, doses. They set a
   time limit: "Okay, I'm going to get high until midnight, but that's
   enough. There's always a next time."

   Temporary abstinence really increases the power of the next high.
   Between parties, connoisseurs go without cocaine, and space coke
   sessions well apart. They pay attention to that feeling of revulsion
   for cocaine that chronic users often get: it means it's time to stop
   using coke for a while. Only if the lag is present can the body and
   mind restore themselves to normal health; and only then is the reward
   worthwhile. Connoisseurs go easy and live.

   COCAINE HANDBOOK

   An Essential Reference

   By David Lee

   We are offering David Lee’s work for your viewing pleasure in the
   spirit that he intended, to help spread the actual facts about cocaine.
   May his spirit live on in memory via the DarkNets.

   Now that it has come into everyday use, however, it is important that
   its chemical reactions should be as well known as those of quinine or
   caffeine, since it is now liable to come under observation in
   medico-legal investigations. It is also desirable that the physical
   properties of cocaine salts should be familiar, so that purchasers may
   be on their guard against substitutions or adulterations.

   FOIL BURN TESTS

   Foil burn tests as shown on the opposite page are done with about 10
   milligrams of sample which is placed on aluminum foil and gently heated
   from below with a butane lighter. The residue is then examined. (For
   set-up of the foil burn test, see black-and-white photos on pages 102
   and 103.)

   57: (top row, left) MERCK COCAINE: Even pharmaceutically pure cocaine
   leaves a small orange-brown residue.

   58: (lop row, middle) HIGHLY-REFINED ILLICIT COCAINE (the "Book
   standard") leaves a residue similar to that of pharmaceutical cocaine.
   The trace amounts of impurities account for the slightly darker color.

   59: (top row, right) "PERUVIAN FLAKE": Although the sample was
   unadulterated, the presence of other alkaloids and impurities produces
   a darker brown residue than that shown in color plates 57 and 58.

   60: (second row, left) "BOLIVIAN ROCK": While the cocaine content of
   "Bolivian rock" is usually higher than that of Peruvian, this sample
   was not well refined, and the impurities leave an almost black residue.

   In all the remaining tests, the "Book standard" cocaine was cut with
   different adulterants so that the sample used was 25% adulterant and
   75% purified cocaine hydrochloride. For the test in the last color
   plate shown here, more adulterants were added so that the final sample
   contained 50% adulterants. In each instance (except the lidocaine
   hydrochloride and cocaine in color plate 66), the cocaine and cuts were
   mixed by screening them together.

   61: (second row, middle) COCAINE AND MANNITOL: Compared to color plate
   58 (top row, middle), the added mannitol causes a black residue.

   62: (second row, right) COCAINE AND LACTOSE: Here a black,
   charcoal-like residue is seen. The burning sample has a caramel
   consistency, and the smoke has the odor of burnt sugar.

   63: (third row, left) COCAINE AND QUININE: When quinine is present, the
   residue is very pronounced, similar to a spot of dry India ink.

   64: (third row, middle) COCAINE AND INOSITOL: This reacts much like the
   mannitol (second row, middle), but more burning is observed, and the
   residue is charcoal-like in appearance.

   65: (third row, right) COCAINE AND CAFFEINE: The reaction of caffeine
   is so similiar to that of the "Book standard" cocaine (top row, middle)
   that this adulterant cannot be detected with the foil burn test.

   66: (bottom row, left) COCAINE AND LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE: The residue
   here is slightly darker than "Book standard" (top row, middle), but
   shows no charcoal-like spot as in color plates 62and 64. Detecting
   lidocaine with this test is virtually impossible.

   67: (bottom row, middle) COCAINE AND LIDOCAINE BASE: When lidocaine
   base is the cut, the residue is almost identical to the "Book standard"
   cocaine.

   68: (bottom row, right) COCAINE AND MANNITOL LACTOSE, AND SPEED: This
   "street" cocaine has been cut a number of times; each time it is cut.
   It is more likely to fail the foil burn test.

   SUMMARY OF FOIL BURN TESTS

   The foil burn test alone shows little conclusively. High-quality
   unrefined "Bolivian rock" cocaine can leave a dark residue, while
   cocaine cut with lidocaine or caffeine leaves very little residue. When
   sugar or quinine cuts are present, however, they always leave a dark
   residue. When combined with the results of other tests, information
   derived from foil burn tests can lead to more specific conclusions.

   Most cocaine consumers are in agreement that it has become increasingly
   difficult to obtain high quality illicit cocaine. Prices have risen,
   quality has dropped, and the alternatives are few. While this is due to
   a variety of circumstances, the cocaine market, like any other, is
   governed by the laws of supply and demand. When the demand greatly
   exceeds the supply, it becomes a sellers' market, a condition which
   rarely benefits the consumer.

   The amount of illicit cocaine which is consumed annually in the United
   States has increased dramatically in the past 5 years and the demand
   put on suppliers has risen accordingly. Nowhere is this more widely
   felt than in South America where the coca leaves which produce the
   cocaine are grown. The need for larger quantities of leaves from which
   cocaine can be made has prompted increased coca production throughout
   South America. Cultivation has extended to remote areas which for
   various environmental reasons were never considered prime sources of
   leaves. The result of changes in climate and soil conditions on coca is
   usually a lowering of the cocaine content and an increased
   concentration of the related alkaloids. The suppliers are largely
   unaware of these changes and most don't really care. In the kitchens of
   Colombia, "If its an alkaloid, its cocaine," and that's that.

   The buyer usually represents one of the larger organizations in
   Colombia. He obtains the pasta, usually no more than three kilos per
   trip, and transports it to a base lab somewhere in Colombia. Other
   buyers who represent the same organization will bring their pasta to
   the same base lab. The pasta is combined with little regard to
   variances in quality or origin, and is made into base which may then be
   transported to a crystal lab located in or near one of the major cities
   in Colombia.

   The crystal lab receives base from many base labs. The bases are
   combined (regardless of qualitative differences) and crystallized. This
   resultant cocaine hydrochloride is not from Colombia, and it's really
   not from Peru or Bolivia either. Its origin would more accurately be
   termed Potpourri since it involves the materials and labor of as many
   as 2000 farmers, 200 guides, 200 buyers, 20 base labs, and several
   crystal labs - all this before entering the United States.

   The majority of illicit cocaine which is smuggled into the U.S.A. comes
   from Potpourri. It arrives by air or sea in massive loads weighing as
   much as 100 kilos. In such large shipments there are always variations
   in quality. The whiter cocaine is considered to be the purest and will
   go for the highest price. Distributors in the United States are usually
   required to take a certain number of the discolored kilos in order to
   obtain some of the "better" product. When scientific testing is used,
   it is often found that whiter does not necessarily mean better.

   The smuggler usually deals with as few people as possible. He sells or
   fronts his merchandise to a select number of wholesalers who deal in
   various parts of the country. They travel to the cocaine's port of
   entry, usually Florida, to inspect the load and arrange for
   transportation of the cocaine to their distribution area. Since many
   kilos are likely to be involved, the load is rarely examined except for
   its aesthetic properties (look, smell, and taste). The wholesaler knows
   that there will be variations in quality from bag to bag and he is
   rarely allowed to choose the kilos he prefers. More often than not,
   it's all or nothing at all.

   Once the cocaine has arrived at a safe house in the wholesaler's
   territory, it is weighed, inventoried, and perhaps given its first
   close examination. This may range from a careful analysis of quality to
   a simple foil bum test. A measure of the product's value is often
   determined by how many times it can be cut and still be sellable. Up to
   this point, if the cocaine has been cut, it was usually done without
   the knowledge of the people in charge. It is often workers within the
   organization who will attempt to make a little extra by diluting the
   cocaine with a substance of lesser value. It is therefore not uncommon
   for a load which has been inspected in Florida to have changed by the
   time it reaches its destination.

   A wholesaler rarely sells less than a kilo at a time, usually more and
   to several major distributors. The smugglers, wholesalers, and major
   distributors are the upper echelon of the cocaine business. The volume
   of product they handle is often too great to permit either grading or
   adulteration. While kilos may be as different as night and day they are
   just more products to sell and are all handled in the same way; poured
   from bag to bag like sacks of flour with little regard about spilling
   or exact weights.
   Chapter3Insert1500w564h

   From the major distributors on, cocaine dealers are hard to
   characterize since they come from all walks of life. Most use it
   themselves but deal primarily to make money in addition to earning what
   they use. In general, the smaller the volume a quantity dealer handles,
   the further down the line he is and the more likely his product has
   been adulterated.

   To the gram buyer of cocaine, it is his connection who is the source.
   While quite detached from the politics of the larger cocaine trade, his
   customers still depend on him for information regarding the nature and
   purity of the cocaine. Often, the source is as uninformed as the
   customer, and since he is likely to have a financial interest in the
   sale, he may be the least interested in passing along meaningful
   information about the cocaine. An unscrupulous source may find that he
   can increase his profits by adulterating or light weighting the
   cocaine. The consumer who has no alternative may find each purchase to
   be an expensive lesson.

   The type of source which is most often encountered by the gram buyer of
   cocaine is the dealer-user. This person defrays the cost of consuming
   cocaine by selling moderate quantities. Contrary to the media image of
   a cocaine dealer, the dealer-user is usually far from being a
   "superfly." In many cases he may be a marijuana dealer who occasionally
   sells cocaine. This person normally makes money selling marijuana, but
   tends to take cocaine as his profit on cocaine transactions. The
   successful dealer-user must usually make a quick turnover in order to
   avoid consuming more than just the profit. Where this is not possible,
   the cocaine is often adulterated so as to avoid a loss.

   The most common purchase made by the dealer-user is one-quarter of one
   ounce, 7 grams. This is broken down into grams and half-grams which are
   usually packaged in a hand-folded envelope called a bindle. The selling
   price is variable and is rarely concurrent with quality, but the
   typical dealer-user will try to make one to 2 grams on the purchase of
   a quarter-ounce. If the cost of the 7 grams is 600 dollars, and the
   dealer-user wants to make 2 grams, he must sell the 5 remaining grams
   for the 600 dollars he paid for the quarter-ounce. The result is a gram
   price of 120 dollars. Often, grams are light-weighted in order to
   increase the profit. The "nine-tenths of a gram per gram" is very
   common. Applied to the sale of 5 grams, the result is an extra one-half
   gram to snort or sell. The best way for the gram buyer to avoid being
   cheated is to understand precisely what he is buying. "Don't be afraid
   to ask!" is sound consumer advice.

   The consumer should understand that constant ingestion of cocaine can
   impair the user's judgment. When this is combined with poor integrity,
   the result is often overly adulterated cocaine. A dealer in this
   condition is more likely to make a questionable purchase in order to
   maintain his own supply. The cocaine may sell slowly, forcing the
   dealer to adulterate the product in order to lower the selling price or
   to make up for what has been consumed.

   If the consumer finds that he is dissatisfied with his source, a
   determination should be made as to whether the source lacks integrity
   or expertise. A copy of this book should correct a lack of expertise. A
   lack of integrity can only be corrected by finding another source for
   cocaine.

   On a more positive note, the dealer who has consistently treated his
   customers with respect and consideration by supplying a good product at
   fair weights exhibits good integrity. When such integrity is displayed
   regularly, the consumer is more likely to be treated consistently in
   this fashion. However, the nature of the cocaine trade dictates a
   consumer policy of occasionally double-checking the source. If there is
   a discrepancy, the buyer should feel free to inform the seller and
   discuss the transaction. The seller will almost always attempt to
   satisfy a regular customer who approaches him in a reasonable manner.

   Perhaps one of the most important of the unwritten laws of the cocaine
   trade concerns Cocaine Karma. Success in the cocaine business is often
   dependent on how a seller treats his customers. A person who
   misrepresents a product is likely to be caught at his own game. While
   adulteration or light-weighting may bring more immediate rewards, the
   long-term effects are apt to be more negative. On the other hand,
   honest dealers tend to attract honest customers. They may make less
   money per transaction, but they tend to be around a lot longer.

   "Stick a pin almost anywhere in the South American map and you hit a
   plantation, or a laboratory, or a grass warehouse or an airstrip," a
   U.S. State Department narcotics specialist told me with pessimistic
   hyperbole. "There is probably nothing short of communist revolution or
   nuclear obliteration that will stop it."...


   ... Continent-wide-cocaine production now totals more than 100 tons a
   year, with local consumption and confiscations accounting for less than
   a quarter. More than two-thirds of exports go to the United States, but
   European demand is climbing steadily.

   "We have someone jump on $500,000 bond almost every week. When somebody
   can put up $500,000 or $1 million bond straight cash, that's a clue
   anybody can see: We're never going to see that guy again.

   Assistant U.S. Attorney Pat Sullivan — after a suspect of a $9 million
   (874 pounds of cocaine base) arrest had posted bond of $1 million in
   cash. The suspect did not appear for trial. AP Miami 1980

   Can anything be done to end this sorry cycle of bad cocaine, bad
   bargains and bad karma? Legalization would do it, but that step is
   hardly imminent. A consumer boycott, a refusal to buy adulterated crap,
   would stop it too. Not that this is a likely prospect either, but it
   would work. Dealers, after all, are merchants, and if their customers
   won't buy inferior goods, they'll soon make sure that something better
   is available.

   Richard Ashley, High Times, 1979

   Chapter Three

   Understanding The Cocaine Trade

   Despite repeated half-hearted government attempts to prohibit new
   planting and to encourage sowing of substitute crops, the ever-growing
   demand for the raw material of the "champagne of drugs" is spreading
   coca farming across stony mountain sides, freshly cleared jungle, and
   even across the thriving coffee and citrus farms of the Bolivian
   Yungas, steadily being chopped down to make way for the more profitable
   coca bushes.

   Appendix & Glossary

   Appendix A

   Discontinuing Cocaine Abuse

   In any discussion regarding cocaine addiction, the problem is not the
   absence of facts; there are more than enough facts available. The
   problem lies in resolving the conflicts between the facts and relating
   them to the personal use of cocaine.

   There seems to be no physical addiction. The physical effects of
   cocaine used in moderation are mild except when injected or used over
   extended periods of time. In Licit and Illicit Drugs, Edward M Brecher
   states; "A cocaine user, even after prolonged use of large doses, does
   not, if deprived of his drug, suffer from a dramatic withdrawal
   syndrome. The physical effects of cocaine withdrawal are minor," This
   should not be interpreted to mean that no one becomes addicted to
   cocaine. It merely means that regular use of the drug does not create a
   physiological need for the drug.

   Some people are content with occasional use of cocaine, while others
   acquire a habit. Of those that acquire the habit, some acquire it by
   inclination or preference and are able to discontinue use without
   severe discomfort. But what about those who feel compelled to use
   cocaine to the point of debilitation. If cocaine is not addicting, why
   are people drawn to its use? If the answer does not lie in the body, it
   must lie in the mind and in life.

   The key to kicking any habit is personal desire. Until there is desire
   to quit smoking, drinking, cocaine use or television viewing, most
   attempts will end in failure. If you find you are afflicted with a
   cocaine habit, and you find it is hurting your life physically and
   spiritually, you must find and nurse the desire to stop the use of
   cocaine.

   Sometimes it is hard to recognize such a habit. Mr, Brecher states that
   cocaine withdrawal .. is characterized by a profound psychological
   manifestation-depression-for which cocaine itself appears to the user
   to be the only remedy .. " In other words, 'coming down' from a cocaine
   high leaves you depressed, a depression you do not associate with the
   euphoric effects of cocaine. You feel the cocaine remedies this
   depression and fail to recognize that the depression is caused by the
   initial dose.

   You should be aware of the effects of cocaine on mental processes.
   Louis Levin wrote a description of these effects in his 1924 book,
   Phantastica: "Will-power diminishes, and indecision, lack of a sense of
   duty, capricious temper, obstinacy, forgetfulness, diffuseness in
   writing and speech, physical and intellectual instability set in.
   Conscientiousness is replaced by negligence, truthful people become
   liars and the lover of society seeks solitude," Lewin's statement
   describes a composite effect. Not all people feel all these emotions;
   with some the effects are not pronounced: still others feel the effects
   quite intensely. If you have a cocaine habit, it is hard for you to
   view objectively the effect on your life. If you can't decide whether
   you are using too much cocaine; your indecision is a good indication
   that you are.

   If you are an irrational or insecure individual, you may consider it
   impossible to discontinue cocaine use. You will have a tendency to feel
   you are incapable of quitting, so why try? Even if you understand the
   abuse of cocaine is detremental to your physical and mental health, you
   will feel compelled to snort. The best method of countering addiction
   is to remove yourself physically from cocaine and the environment that
   will give your cocaine habit reinforcement. Once this has been done,
   you must understand you may relapse if you are again exposed to cocaine
   use. Strive to improve your self-esteem and learn to feel secure about
   your own identity Both steps are extremely hard and your success in
   this effort must depend greatly on the people closest to you. If you
   are rationally motivated, understanding your reasons for abusing
   cocaine may be sufficient for you to control or discontinue your habit.

   There is also an addiction that springs from a life which is so boring,
   unfulfilling, unmotivated, miserable or poverty-stricken that you feel
   the only way you can tolerate life on a day-to-day basis is to alter
   your mental state with chemicals. This must be countered on both the
   personal and social level. If you are abusing cocaine because you find
   life boring or unmotivating, you have to realize the problem lies in
   your own perspective. The key lies in desire. If you desire a change in
   your drug habit, you must look for a way to change your life. You
   should combat boredom and lack of motivation by becoming involved in
   activities with people you admire, or which will give you personal
   satisfaction. The reinforcement you receive for your efforts will
   motivate you. The use of drugs in these instances will gradually be
   placed in perspective or discontinued. If your life is so miserable or
   poverty-stricken that you feel the need to use cocaine to enable you to
   cope with it, answers on a personal level are harder to find. If your
   condition of existence were improved, you would probably use cocaine
   sparingly as an occasional high or discontinue its use entirely. If it
   is in your power to improve your material position, you must have the
   desire.

   When the power to improve your material position in life is not in your
   hands, there a other considerations. Governmental agencies, social
   agencies, and medical authorities approach the problem of drug abuse as
   basically caused by the properties of the drug. As long as this policy
   continues there will be widespread drug abuse. Only when meaningful
   attempts and coordinated efforts at improving the quality of life are
   made can there be progress made toward reducing or eradicating drug
   dependency. As long as these agencies are allowed to ignore that basic
   truth, they will continue to abrogate the responsibility placed in
   their hands by the people of this country.

   In closing, reference can be made to a statement made by Richard T.
   Martin in his paper, "The Role of Coca in the History, Religion, and
   Medicine of South American Indians, published in Economic Botany #24,
   1970- "The easiest way to resolve the conflicting reports on the
   effects of coca use is to recognize the fact that, like any other
   potent medicinal agent, coca is beneficial when used appropriately and
   is detrimental when used in excess.”

   This appendix originally appeared in the Cocaine Consumer's Handbook in
   1976: It is worth repeating.



   Appendix B


   Labs

   This is a list of labs which do analysis of street drugs. When the use
   of illicit drugs expanded in the '60s the problem of adulteration and
   misrepresentation became common and about a hundred labs started
   operating to provide accurate information as to the contents of street
   drugs.

   However, by the time the Cocaine Handbook was first published in 1981,
   escalating official pressure and restrictive legislation had reduced
   the number to 9. At present, in 1987, the number of labs has decreased
   even further and now only 3 remain. These labs provide only qualitative
   (what's in it, not how much of each) results because it is illegal to
   provide any quantitative information to the general public.

   The time needed to get results from these labs means that they would
   probably not be much help to testing quality before purchase. When a
   dealer has stock to sell it's usually available for only a short rime
   so it would all be sold by the time the analysis is done. The main use
   could be to check the quality of something a consumer is about to use,
   or has used. The accuracy of these labs has been questioned from time
   to time; one way of checking this might be to send the same sample to
   all 3 of the labs and see if they agree.

   Health Centers

   Problems associated with cocaine abuse vary with the particular
   situation. Individuals with an overdose problem are advised to go
   directly to a hospital emergency room. For less acute problems of abuse
   there are thousands of public and private treatment and counseling
   centers in the U.S. Individual states publish a resource directory of
   such centers and it may be obtained by writing to the stated department
   of health and welfare. The telephone directory lists crisis
   intervention agencies in the front of the book and many communities
   also have a "hot line" which can locate such centers. Many options are
   available, so shopping around is probably a good idea. Fees for public
   organizations an: often on a sliding scale — from free up, depending on
   income. Group therapy can be as low as $20.00 a week. Private care is
   usually more expensive but sometimes a sliding scale of fees also
   operates. In-hospital care can range from $350 to $4000 a week.

   In the original book there is a long listing of facilities next, but
   now in 2015 that list is entirely outdated and therefore has not be
   included.


   Appendix D

   Crack (Garbage Freebase)

   This book was the first to warn cocaine users about the futility of
   freebase smoking, starting with the fact that it's physically
   impossible to recapture the glory of the first hit in subsequent
   attempts. Everything that was said about the dangers of freebase goes
   double for crack.

   The crack phenomenon began when the U.S. Drug Enforcement
   Administration pressured Colombia into outlawing ether, the solvent
   used to convert cocaine base into the hydrochloride. Major labs shifted
   to the Caribbean, where chemists switched to the cruder baking-soda
   process and introduced "baking soda base" to Miami and New York. The
   word "crack" first appeared in the New York Times on November 17, 1985.
   Within a year more than 1,000 press stories about it had appeared.

   The freebasing process was originally designed to remove impurities and
   adulterants leaving only the pure base alkaloid to be smoked.

   Crack, however, is not freebase. Crack processing (boiling cocaine
   dissolved in water with baking soda to produce a waxy substance whose
   vapors are inhaled) does not remove whatever cuts and impurities were
   in the original cocaine; and the baking soda remaining in the product
   actually reduces the purity of 90 percent cocaine hydrochloride to
   about 36 percent cocaine (Street Pharmacologist, Sept. 1986).

   As a result, crack users are inhaling any and all impurities that were
   in the original cocaine, plus baking soda and anything added during the
   process. Remember, crack is not made in labs: adulterants may include
   dirt, insects, blood, and anything the dealer feels like adding to make
   more weight.

   This garbage is then cut into little chunks and sold for $10-$20
   apiece, mostly to kids and people who don't know much about cocaine.
   The news media must bear responsibility for popularizing crack—almost
   even- story told dealers that by converting their street coke to even
   shoddier crack, they could double their money. Every consumer should be
   aware that despite the lower unit price, crack is more expensive than
   cocaine.

   Finally, crack hits fast and lets you down suddenly. The depression
   that occurs about six minutes after taking a bit is so strong that
   almost everyone wants another hit immediately. Thus use leads instantly
   to abuse. There is no middle ground of "social use" with crack.

   The social or recreational cocaine user would be well advised to stay
   away from crack, freebase, and intravenous use of the drug. These
   extremes lead very quickly to mental, emotional and physical problems,
   and make the habit much harder to kick.

   Chapter Two

   The Alkaloids

   Very little is known about the physiological activity of the associate
   alkaloids of the coca plant, and still less about their effects in
   combination. The necessity of looking into the possible importance of
   these other compounds is emphasized by the fact that an Indian will
   frequendy reject the bitter coca leaves with the highest percentage of
   cocaine in favor of the sweeter leaves which are richer in the more
   aromatic alkaloids.

   Richard T. Martin, Economic Botany, 1970

   Cocaine is only one of the alkaloids contained in the leaves of the
   plant Erythroxylum coca. Varying amounts of several other similar
   alkaloids will also be present, depending on the particular species of
   coca which is used, where it is grown, and the manner by which it is
   refined.

   Most uncut illicit cocaine will consist primarily of three or four
   alkaloids; these include: cocaine, cocamine (truxillines),
   cinnamylcocaine, and the hygrines. In addition, benzoylecgonine is
   found in minute quantities or in larger amounts when the cocaine has
   decomposed. Tropacocaine is rarely present in South American coca but
   does occur significantly in Java coca.

   As well as the alkaloids which naturally occur in coca, mixed alkaloid
   cocaine will often contain ecgonine. As with benzoylecgonine, ecgonine
   is produced when the cocaine has decomposed. This can happen
   intentionally, but is usually caused by attempting to force a higher
   yield from the leaves, paste, or base.

   Licit pharmaceutical cocaine, used in medicine as a local anesthetic,
   is manufactured legally under optimum laboratory conditions. In this
   process all alkaloids which can be converted to cocaine are used. This
   includes three alkaloids which have ecgonine at the core of their
   molecule; cocaine {methyl benzoylecgonine), cinnamylcocaine (methyl
   cinnamylecgonlne), and cocamine (methyl truxilloylecgonine). The
   molecules arc split into their main parts, the ecgonine portion saved,
   and the rest eliminated. Once isolated, the ecgonine may be
   synthetically converted to cocaine (methyl benzoylecgonine).

   The advantage of this process is a higher yield of cocaine from coca
   which contains predominately cocamine or cinnamylcocaine. The
   disadvantage of the process is that it is technically demanding and
   requires exacting technique, special chemicals, and sophisticated
   laboratory equipment.

   The ecgonine conversion process has been used by chemists since 1885
   but is virtually unknown to the "cooks" or South America who make most
   of the illicit cocaine. Prior to its discovery, cocaine was refined in
   much the same way that is used by illicit manufacturers today. While
   both techniques begin with the extraction of all alkaloids, the illicit
   process (when properly conducted) seeks to eliminate all alkaloids but
   cocaine. The pharmaceutical process eliminates only those alkaloids
   which cannot be made into cocaine.

   It should be pointed out that only the ecgonine process will totally
   eliminate the related alkaloids so that the only alkaloid at the end is
   cocaine. The illicit process will always leave traces of the other
   alkaloids. Whereas pharmaceutical cocaine hydrochloride will be 89.27%
   cocaine base by weight, illicit mixed-alkaloid cocaine hydrochloride
   will rarely be more than 80% cocaine base. When the illicit process is
   used on species of coca which have high concentrations of other
   alkaloids, the amount of cocaine base may drop to 50% or lower.

   When discussing the illicit process, it is important to consider the
   conditions under which it is performed. The illicit processor rarely
   has access to the wide range of quality chemicals available in the
   United States and Europe. The process is carried out by "cooks" who
   know little about chemistry and routinely use substitute solvents and
   chemicals, depending on what is available. (This would be impossible
   when using the pharmaceutical process).
   ChemicalStructureChap2In1500w670h

   As a South American "cook" once said, "All you need to make cocaine is
   three buckets and two sheets." Many cooks actually use this method. The
   work is done in makeshift laboratories more reminiscent of kitchens,
   and the sheets (complete with multiple kilos) are often hung on a
   clothesline to dry in the sun. Time is of the essence, and one never
   knows when a cocaine kitchen may have to be moved at a moment's notice.
   Lengthy procedures are abbreviated to meet this criterion and quality
   is often sacrificed in the process.

   There are three kinds of laboratories which deal with different parts
   of the procedure. The pasta lab is usually located at or near the
   growing area and is used to extract all the alkaloids in the form of a
   water-soluble paste. This crude cocaine sulfate, called pasta, is far
   less bulky than the leaves themselves, and the extraction procedure and
   laboratory requirements are simple enough to be performed by the coca
   growers. (It takes 100-150 kilos of dry leaves to produce one kilo of
   dry pasta.) All that is required is to soak the dried leaves in water,
   add a strong alkali like lime to release the alkaloids, and stir in a
   solvent like kerosene or gasoline which will dissolve the alkaloids
   while remaining separate from the water. The water is drained out the
   bottom of the container and the gasoline is poured out the top. Once
   the gasoline has been separated, sulfuric acid is added to precipitate
   the alkaloids. The precipitate, called pasta, is separated from the
   gasoline by filtration and put out in the sun to dry. (In Bolivia,
   where the predominant alkaloid is cocaine, hydrochloric acid is often
   substituted for sulfuric acid, and the resultant hydrochloride is the
   finished product.)

   The dry pasta is usually tannish brown, the color coming from plant
   material, dirt, etc. It usually contains all compounds which will
   precipitate with lime and dissolve in gasoline. If a stronger alkali is
   used, more compounds will be present.

   The next step of the process is to convert the pasta to base. This is
   usually done in a base lab located in Colombia and is a very critical
   pan of the procedure since it determines the amount and proportions of
   different alkaloids which will be present in the finished product.
   Parts of this conversion are routinely left out due to the time
   involved, weight losses, and potential risk to the cocaine. When
   properly performed, the conversion to base will eliminate
   cinnamylcocaine and the hygrincs, as well as most organic impurities.

   The conversion is properly performed by dissolving the pasta in water
   and adding sulfuric acid to further acidify the solution. Potassium
   permanganate is added to the solution, causing it to turn a violet
   color. This oxidation process does not appreciably affect the cocaine,
   but the oils and impurities are attacked almost immediately. The
   critical part of the process is deciding when to stop the action of the
   permanganate by adding an alkali. If the decision is made too early,
   the resultant base will contain more impurities and other alkaloids; if
   the decision is made too late, some cocaine will be destroyed by the
   permanganate. There is hardly an experienced cook who has not
   over-oxidized the pasta at one time or another. Never was it more true
   that "close only counts in horseshoes."

   The owners of the pasta are not involved for the fun of it — their
   purpose is to make money. The loss of a quantity of cocaine due to
   overoxidation of the pasta is hardly an effective means of increasing
   the profit, so, more often than not, this part of the process is
   eliminated. Why take the chance when the cocaine will sell anyway!

   Pasta which is converted to base without being oxidized with
   permanganate rarely results in cocaine hydrochloride which is over 60%
   cocaine base. Cocaine hydrochloride made from properly oxidized base
   may be as much as 82% cocaine base.

   The last step of the process is to convert the base to "crystal," the
   South American term for cocaine hydrochloride. This is usually done in
   a crystal lab located in or near a major city in Colombia. The base is
   dissolved in ether, and hydrochloric acid is added to precipitate the
   cocaine hydrochloride crystals. These are collected by filtration and
   are then dried. It is rare for this process to be performed with less
   than three kilos, and as many as fifty may be done at one time. The
   crystallization is performed as quickly as possible, taking as little
   as fifteen minutes where a more professional procedure might take
   hours.

   Since most illicit cocaine is made the quick way, with the emphasis on
   quantity, it often contains an alkaloid proportion similar to that
   which existed in the leaves themselves. This is not necessarily bad
   because most consumers of cocaine seem to prefer the mellower high of
   mixed-alkaloid cocaine to the speedy but clear high of the
   pharmaceutical product. One must remember that, in medicine, cocaine is
   used as a local anesthetic; the presence of other alkaloids makes it
   less effective as such. However, when the cocaine is used as a
   recreational drug, the same reasoning may not hold true.

   Aside from cocaine, the alkaloids which are of the most interest to the
   consumer are cocaomine and the hygrines. This is of course due to the
   large amount of these substances which are present in illicit cocaine.

   Cocamine* (truxilline) was first discovered in what was then called
   Trujillo coca and was for many years confused with cocaine due to the
   remarkable similarities between the two and the difficulty in
   separating them. Its chemical formula is very close to that of cocaine,
   the main difference being the kind of acid which is produced when the
   molecule decomposes. Cocaine decomposes to methyl alcohol, benzoic
   acid, and ecgonine, while cocamine breaks down to methyl alcohol,
   truxillic acid, and ecgonine. This difference results in an alkaloid
   which is considerably less active than cocaine, with little or no
   anesthetic value and distinctly different psychoactive qualities.
   Cocamine acts on the muscular system while cocaine acts on the nervous
   system. Cocamine is amorphous (noncrystalline), and when present with
   cocaine will lessen its crystallinity and diminish its brilliance. The
   taste of cocamine is more bitter than cocaine, with little or no
   numbing effect. The effects of consuming cocaine which has a
   significant amount of cocamine will be more physical in nature, lacking
   the clarity of cocaine. It may actually seem to cause drowsiness.
   PrimaryCocaChap2In2500w506h

   The hygrines were first thought of as a decomposition product produced
   during the manufacture of cocaine. They are in fact a natural component
   of the coca leaf and may be present in quantities as great as 30% of
   the total alkaloid content. The presence of hygrine in illicit cocaine
   is often due to the manufacturer's desire to increase the weight of the
   cocaine. In order for hygrine to precipitate at the same time as
   cocaine, an excess of hydrochloric acid must be used. This often
   results in partial decomposition of the cocaine molecule. (If the extra
   acid is not used, most of the hygrine will remain in the solution from
   which the cocaine has been removed.) The cocaine decomposition is the
   reason that an overabundance of hygrine is usually accompanied by
   benzoylecgonine and ecgonine. A sweet smell, reminiscent of
   wintergreen, is also caused by the breakdown, not by the hygrine.

   The hygrines are colorless, volatile oils which arc extremely alkaline
   and possess a very bitter taste. They do not dull the appearance of the
   cocaine as will cocamine, but they will increase its tendency to
   attract moisture from the air. Since they possess little or no
   psychoactive qualities of their own, they will merely lessen the
   stimulation of cocaine. The excess hydrochloric acid, added when the
   hygrine was precipitated, is very irritating to the nasal membranes.
   When the nose neutralizes the excess acid, the hygrine becomes
   insoluble in water and is poorly absorbed, so it further irritates the
   nose.

   Significant amounts of cocamine and hygrine are found in the leaves of
   Erythroxylum novoaranatemc. While they may be present in other species
   of coca, the amount will be minute by comparison. It is therefore
   logical to assume that mixed-alkaloid cocaine containing large amounts
   of these alkaloids originated in Colombia or Peru.

   When the Colombian cook saw the sophisticated lab he said "all you need
   to make cocaine is three buckets and two sheets." Once in the remote
   mountains of Central America we ran out of filter paper while preparing
   to crystalize a batch. We went into town, rented a hotel room, stole
   the sheets and headed back to the hills where we finished the job.

   -Colombian Cook

   A look at the techniques of the "cooks."

   "They were crystallizing several kilos and discovered they didn't have
   a big enough container. I was sent out to get it and came back with a
   large plastic garbage can. They got to work and I got laid back.
   Screams drew me to the laboratory where the South American chef had his
   foot in the can trying to plug the hole that the ether ate through the
   plastic and his assistant was scooping up the flood off the rug back
   into the trash can. We had to hold back the owner of the house as we
   cut up the rug, but the chef managed to recover 90% of the coke."

   -Manuel the Mule

   To date, some fourteen alkaloids have been isolated from varieties of
   the plant.

   Pharmacologists have burdened us with the notion that drug plants must
   owe their properties to a single "active principle" that can be
   isolated, synthesized, studied, and administered in pure form. This
   notion may be helpful to pharmacologists in making their experiments
   simpler, but it is disastrous to the rest of us because it leads us
   away from natural green medicines in the direction of white powders
   with far higher potentials for abuse.

   -Andrew Weil, The Marriage of the Sun and Moon, 1980

   I had read in the literature that the smell of dirty sock in cocaine
   indicated the presence of cocamine and/or hygrine. Imagine my surprise
   when Cruel Raoul came over and pulled out his stash carefully concealed
   in his dirty sock. I begged to keep the sock, to no avail.

   -David Lee

   The Cocaine Base Test

   The purpose of the cocaine base test is to give the consumer a reliable
   estimate of thc quantity and quality of cocaine alkaloid (cocaine base)
   present in a given sample of cocaine hydrochloride. This is
   accomplished by removing the HCl molecule (along with most street cuts)
   and subjecting the resultant cocaine base to a melting point test to
   determine its purity.

   Quantitative

   Cocaine hydrochloride is a water-soluble salt whose pH is slightly
   acidic (6.0). Since the HCl molecule makes up about 11% of the weight,
   the alkaloid itself can only be 89% of the total In theory, one gram of
   pure cocaine hydrochloride, whether illicit or pharmaceutical, will
   contain 0.89 gram of base. In practice, even with the best lab
   technique, the conversion to base will result in slight losses caused
   by some decomposition of the cocaine molecule. A yield of 0.82-0.86
   gram indicates a hydrochloride which is practically free of
   non-baseable adulterants.

   In order to estimate the percent of baseable material, the salt is
   weighed and then dissolved in water. The base is liberated by the slow
   addition of ammonium hydroxide. This raises the pH of the solution,
   breaks off the acid molecule, and precipitates cocaine base which is
   now insoluble in water. The base is separated from the water, dried,
   and weighed. The dry weight of the base, divided by the weight of the
   hydrochloride, equals the percent of baseable material.
   Chapter6Img24600w780h

   Qualitative

   In addition to the associate coca alkaloids, many substances which are
   used to adulterate cocaine can convert to bases. Accordingly, an 89%
   yield does not in itself indicate that the cocaine hydrochloride was
   pure. If special attention is paid to the way the "cocaine" solution
   reacts to the cocaine base process, indications of baseable adulterants
   may be noticed. The melting point is the other important indicator of
   the purity of the alkaloid.

   Cocaine is a very weak base which requires a minimum of alkali to
   precipitate it from its water solution. A single drop of ammonium
   hydroxide is sufficient to produce a white precipitate; when vigorously
   stirred the solution becomes milky. Within a few minutes, the solution
   will begin to clear as the base forms crystals. Further addition of
   ammonia should produce a similar reaction until the pH of thc water is
   about 7.6. At this point, a drop of ammonia will not produce a visible
   white precipitate since all the cocaine has been liberated.

   Cocaine which contains hygrine, or has been adulterated with a stronger
   base like lidocaine, will require more alkali for complete
   precipitation, A single drop of ammonia will produce a visible white
   precipitate which becomes milky when stirred. However, the base will
   not separate from the water as crystals, and the solution will
   therefore remain milky. It requires additional ammonia before
   separation occurs and the water clarifies. By the time all the base has
   been liberated, the pH of the water will be 8 or higher.

   While the salts of many baseable adulterants have melting points close
   to that of cocaine, the bases often melt at temperatures which are
   quite different.

   Pharmaceutical cocaine base will melt at 96-98° C. It contains no other
   alkaloids to lower the temperature.

   Uncut illicit cocaine base, which may be as much as 90-95% cocaine,
   will melt at 92-95° C. There should be no capillary reaction at
   temperatures below 90°C

   Uncut Potpourri cocaine base, which is rarely over 80% cocaine, will
   melt at 89-92° C The presence of cocamine (melting point approximately
   80° C.) or hygrine causes a capillary reaction below 90° C.

   When lidocaine is present in any of the above bases, the first reaction
   can occur as low as 60° C. and certainly below 80° C. Most likely the
   entire melt will be complete before the temperature reaches 90° C.

   While the results vary depending on the substance which is causing the
   deviation, it is obvious when the base is not pure. An experienced
   tester can make a fairly accurate estimation of the percent of cocaine
   alkaloid which is present.

   As with the melting point test, practice makes perfect. Novices at
   testing are usually so unsure of their technique that if a test fails
   they think that it was due to their error. Only experience will make
   this uncertainty disappear. Perhaps it was not the technique but the
   lack of cocaine which made the test fail.

   An accurate cocaine base test may be performed with as little as 0.20
   gram of cocaine hydrochloride. The inexperienced tester, however, may
   find that 0.50-1.0 0 grams is an easier amount with which to maintain
   accuracy. A reliable test depends on exacting technique and the use of
   a scale which is accurate to within 1/100 of a gram.

   In the Lab

   To the professional chemist with access to the most recent technology,
   the problem of testing for purity and adulterants is almost a trivial
   one. Whereas the street tests available to the consumer require
   judgments which might be influenced by some financial loss or gain, the
   professional systems are based mainly on instrument readings. One might
   understand the street tester making an error in judgment due to this
   personal involvement; the professional chemist has no such excuse.

   The professionals engaged in lab testing of cocaine are mainly
   governmental and law enforcement agencies, researchers in universities,
   drug companies, and some labs licensed by the government to do analysis
   for the public. Until a few years ago, public analysis labs could
   legally divulge quantitative as well as qualitative information. An
   individual submitting a sample could therefore learn not only which
   compounds were present, but also the exact percentage of each. The
   logic of discontinuing the percent composition report was that it would
   help drug dealers to test quality and thereby encourage dealing. More
   likely, however, when the street-level consumer realized that he was
   being sold 10% cocaine and 90% adulterants at $100 per gram, he would
   be less likely to throw away his money, not buy the gram, and thereby
   discourage dealing. On the other hand, being able to sell cheap
   adulterants to the uninformed public at $100 per gram and realize 500 -
   1000% profit on the cocaine is more likely to encourage new dealers to
   compromise their integrity in search of a fast buck. Since the budget
   of the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) is proportional to the
   problems it faces, many jobs are dependent on continued drug traffic.
   If ever the DEA were able to stop drug dealing, it would remove the
   reason for its existence. Under the present system, the ironic result
   is that increased drug traffic benefits both the dealers and the DEA,
   with the consumer getting the short end from both sides.
   Chapter6Img34600w570h

   The methods used in professional labs vary with the kind of information
   being sought. While the classical melting points, color reactions, and
   crystal derivation tests are used, most are only valid if the sample is
   free of interfering substances, that is, unadulterated. The usual
   procedure, therefore, is first to separate the sample into its
   different components and then test for the compounds of interest.

   The most sophisticated tools used are a gas chromatograph coupled to a
   high-resolution mass spectrometer. These provide information about the
   specific atomic makeup of an unknown molecule. The necessary equipment
   can cost $50,000 and up. The least expensive, but still sophisticated
   method, thin-layer chromatography, separates compounds in a mixture
   from each other. This shows the relative purity of the sample. When
   coupled to a spectrophotometer, a percentage can be estimated.
   Thin-layer chromatography equipment can cost less than $100, but the
   spectrophotometer is in the $1000 range.

   Forensic labs need information which can be provided with the less
   expensive equipment since they are only concerned with a few illegal
   substances. The researchers interested in the chemistry of the mother
   plant or in the chemistry of the drug after it has been ingested by an
   animal may need the information about all the other (and possibly
   previously undiscovered) compounds present. For this kind of
   information, the most sophisticated system may be necessary.

   Laboratory studies done on the effects of cocaine on animals and humans
   are necessarily done with pure cocaine. The regulations on human
   experimentation are very strict, so using street cocaine in any such
   study would be virtually impossible. The reality, then, is that the few
   experiments done under controlled conditions may miss much of the
   physiological and psychological effects of the cocaine most people use
   — in particular, the possible interaction of other alkaloids which may
   produce different types of highs. Whether these variations are the
   result of different dosages, the presence of other alkaloids, or added
   adulterants, is at this point unclear; everyone with first-hand
   experience has his own opinion of what is happening. Considering the 10
   to 20 million Americans performing these experiments at an expense of
   $25 to $50 billion per year, it would seem to merit further attention
   from medical researchers.

   WARNING!

   Some of the procedures documented, especially those involving volatile
   solvents or concentrated acids and alkalis may be extremely hazardous.
   The reader is cautioned not to perform any of these procedures. The
   procedures described should only be performed under laboratory
   conditions by professional chemists operating under the authority of
   the proper government re ovulatory agencies.
