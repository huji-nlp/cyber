Pay Online and receive your VIAGRA in 24 Hours Even though the problems that Viagra helps to solve are very personal, in many countries of the world the process of obtaining this medication still involves a lot of embarrassing social interaction. In fact, having to admit the fact that they are having sexual problems is what stops a lot of men from visiting their doctors and getting Viagra prescribed to them. Some are too shy to talk about sexual problems with their therapists, some are afraid to let their partner know they are using Viagra and some are denying the fact that they need help themselves. But whatever the reason for each particular case is, the outcome is still the same    as many men continue struggling with erectile dysfunction without doctors help or come looking for ways to obtain ED meds without prescription. Is it safe to buy Viagra online over the counter? Is it legal? Is it more expensive than trying to get it from a local brick and mortar pharmacy? Here in this brief article we will try to answer these questions and many more. Lets see if you need that prescription after all. Do I need a prescription in order to buy Viagra? That actually depends on which country you currently reside in. In the US, as well as in Australia, Canada and most European countries, Viagra is sold strictly on prescription-only basis. That means you have to go to your doctor, tell him about your problems, have your health assessed and do a series of tests. Based on the results of those, your healthcare provider will decide if Viagra is suitable for you. If it is, you will get a prescription. If it is not, you will either get an alternative medical treatment or be offered to consider penile injections or prostheses. As for developing countries, its safe to say that most of them sell Viagra without prescriptions. You can buy brand-name Viagra, its generics or other famous ED drugs, such as Cialis or Levitra in practically any pharmacy. India is where you get the widest variety of choice, perhaps    a generic Viagra is produced by dozens, if not hundreds, of manufacturers there and all of them sell their products over the counter. Another interesting example is Mexico or Thailand    there you can buy Viagra without any papers from your doctor even in a 7Eleven! An American supermarket chain selling ED meds without a prescription outside the States while sticking with prescription-only model in the US Thats funny, dont you find? In the UK, a brand-new system of selling Viagra has recently been introduced. Its some sort of a transition between the traditional prescription-only model and the over-the-counter one. There are certain pharmacies where you can buy Viagra after getting your health assessed on the spot by a qualified pharmacist. There will be no tests involved you will only need to answer a few questions about your current health condition in the course of a brief 30-minute conversation. Very convenient, isnt it? How do I get a Viagra prescription? It actually depends on a few factors too your country of residence, your age, the nature of your erectile dysfunction, the symptoms you are experiencing and, finally, on the assessment techniques preferred by your doctor. What you need to start with is visiting your regular doctor or, even better, a professional urologist. Once you are there, tell him or her about the problems you are experiencing. Dont try to hide any facts this may interfere with the diagnosis and cause you some problems. In most of the cases, you will be asked a few general questions, the doctor will take your blood pressure to make sure you dont suffer from hypotension, look up your medical history to make sure you dont have any heart problems and thats it you will get your prescription. You will also get detailed advice on how to use Viagra and what substances to avoid when taking it. The most important here is to avoid taking nitrates when on Viagra. Nitrates are mostly meds used to treat angina (chest pain). However, they are also used as ingredients in recreational drugs called "poppers". Those are usually consumed in clubs and at parties as they help you relax and stimulate your sexual desire. Taken along with Viagra, they increase the risks of suffering from heart attack significantly and are very dangerous. Once you have received your prescription, ask your doctor to send it over to the pharmacy of your choice. Alternatively, you can leave it at the doctors and then do some quick research comparing the prices and delivery options in different drugstores. Once you have found the one that suits you best, send them your doctors name and phone number and they will contact him or her about your prescription. When this is settled, you will be able to pick your pills up from the nearest store or even get them delivered to your door if the pharmacy you purchase them from offers such an option. Is there a way to buy Viagra without prescription? Indeed, there are a few options to choose from if you, for some reason, cant or dont want to get a Viagra prescription. However, if you didnt get a prescription because your doctor told you Viagra wasn 't appropriate for you, we strongly recommend you to avoid resorting to the services of no-prescription pharmacies. Remember that its not by chance that your doctor told you that you couldnt use Viagra. Your decision to disobey your doctors recommendations can result in serious health problems. Get Viagra without a prescription only if you are sure you have ED and that you dont suffer from any health conditions that could be a contraindication to using Viagra. So, first of all, you can easily grab some Viagra while on a trip abroad. Above, we have told that in Mexico, for instance, you can get Viagra over the counter practically everywhere. Thats what US tourists do all the time, in fact in Cancun, which is a very popular destination for travelers from all around the world, there are hundreds of drugstores selling Viagra without any papers required. There is one thing to consider when bringing Viagra back home after the vacation is over though. Dont try to pack your suitcases full of ED meds the customs service will most probably make you show their contents and, if you dont have a prescription, you may face serious penalties. A pack or two or even three are not going to raise any suspicion though. What could be even easier is ordering Viagra without prescription online. THE EASIEST WAY: JUST ORDER YOUR VIGRA FROM US!

Tags: non prescription viagra, viagra without prescriptions, buy viagra without prescription, viagra prescription Non prescription Viagra? Yes or No. All what you need to know. Non prescription Viagra from online pharmacies The best part about getting non prescription Viagra on the Internet is the fact that its perfectly legal. Most of the online pharmacies that dont make you present a prescription when shopping for ED meds online are operating from countries where Viagra is sold over the counter openly. Thus, its virtually identical to going over to that country and buying your ED medication there. You dont break any laws, local or international, you dont risk getting any penalties whats just perfect! Additionally, if you dont want to purchase Viagra from abroad and spend a few days or even weeks waiting for it to be delivered to you, you can buy Viagra without prescription online even in the US. How? Well, there are at least a couple of sites that dont need your doctors approval when selling you erectile dysfunction meds. However, they make you sign a legal disclaimer saying that you are the only one responsible for the outcome of your therapy with Viagra. Thus, you wont be able to file a lawsuit against them if something goes wrong and you get any nasty side effects or something. On the other hand, the risks you are running here are not actually that high because such US-based pharmaceutical retailers are obliged to sell genuine Viagra by Pfizer only. Thus, if you do get any side effects, it would indeed be due to overdose or due to failure to notice some heath conditions that are considered to be contraindications to taking Viagra. Hence, it would be your fault. Things to remember when getting Viagra without prescriptions When you go shopping for Viagra online and want to do it without a prescription, follow a few simple rules that will ensure your maximum safety. First of all, we recommend you to resort to the services of Canadian, Mexican, Indian or European online pharmacies only. There are hardly any counterfeit meds produced in those countries and almost all generic ED meds you can purchase from there are of really high quality. Thus, its relatively safe to buy Viagra from international drugstores operating from there. Additionally, we recommend you to pay maximum attention to the background of the company you are purchasing from as well as of the actual manufacturer of the medication you are purchasing. Spend a couple of hours on googling and researching. There is tons of customer feedback telling the unbiased truth about practically every online drugstore and pharmaceutical company out there with its help you will be able to understand, which meds are safe to order and which are not. Finally, never take Viagra along with nitrates, grapefruit or grapefruit juice or consume more than 100 mg of Sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra) in 24 hours. There are some manufacturers selling Viagra in the strength of 200 mg, which means there are 200 mg of Sildenafil per pill. Never pop those pills whole. Use a pill splitter you can purchase from practically any grocery store and take 1/4-1/2 of the tablet about an hour prior to expected sexual activity. This will give you the virility boost you need without increasing the risks of experiencing side effects. So, as you can see, it is possible to buy Viagra without prescription and still play safe. Please, follow the guidelines outlined in this article and we are sure you will improve your sex life dramatically.
