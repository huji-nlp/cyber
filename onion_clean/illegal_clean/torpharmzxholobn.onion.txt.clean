Tadalafil and Dapoxetine tablet

What is this medicine?

TADALAFIL; DAPOXETINE is proven to help in treatment of impotence and
premature ejaculation. Antidepressants like fluoxetine have long been
used off-label to delay orgasms. The product is fairly new and became
available in early 2010.

taken 1-2 hours before sexual activity. You can take this medicine with
or without food. You should not take the dose more than once per day.
Do not take your medicine more often than directed. If you have been
taking this medicine regularly for some time, do not suddenly stop
taking it.

drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. Some items may interact with your

Currently, there are no documented drug-drug interactions associated
with dapoxetine. Pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to
determine if dapoxetine has any drug interactions with tadalafil and
sildenafil; as well as with ethanol. Both studies demonstrated no
significant interactions when the combination was administered. Due to
the lack of current information, it is too early to speak about other
potential drug interactions.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

If you notice any changes in your vision while taking this drug, call
your doctor or health care professional as soon as possible.

Contact you doctor or health care professional right away if the

upon initiation of sexual activity after taking this medicine, you
should refrain from further activity and call your doctor or health
care professional as soon as possible.

If you have diabetes, this medicine may affect blood sugar levels.
Check your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor or health care professional
if you notice changes.

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do
anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this medicine
affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an
older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.
Alcohol can make you more drowsy and dizzy. Avoid alcoholic drinks.

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy,
and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your doctor if the
problem does not go away or is severe.

Using this medicine does not protect you or your partner against HIV
infection (the virus that causes AIDS) or other sexually transmitted
diseases.

an unusual or allergic reaction to tadalafil, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

minutes before sexual activity. You should not take this dose more than
once per day. Do not take your medicine more often than directed.

Clomiphene tablet

What is this medicine?

CLOMIPHENE is a fertility drug used to increase the chance of getting
pregnant. It is used to help women ovulate (produce a mature egg)
properly during their cycle. Compared to other fertility treatments,
clomiphene alone does not greatly increase your chances of having
multiple babies. An increased chance of having twins may occur in
roughly 5 out of every 100 women who take this medication. Occasionally
clomiphene is prescribed to men with fertility problems due to low
sperm counts.

What should my health care professional know before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
adrenal gland disease
blood vessel disease or blood clots
cyst on the ovary
endometriosis
liver disease
ovarian cancer
pituitary gland disease
vaginal bleeding that has not been evaluated
an unusual or allergic reaction to clomiphene, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives
pregnant (should not be used if you are already pregnant)
breast-feeding

How should I take this medicine?

Take this medicine by mouth with a glass of water. Take e tly as
directed for the e t number of days prescribed. Take your doses at
regular intervals. Most women take this medicine for a 5 day period,
but the length of treatment may be adjusted. Your doctor will give you
a start date for this medication and will give you instructions on
proper use. Do not take your medicine more often than directed.

Talk to your pediatrician regarding the use of this medicine in
children. Special care may be needed.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What if I miss a dose?

If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you can. If it is almost time
for your next dose, take only that dose. Do not take double or extra
doses.

What may interact with this medicine?

herbal or dietary supplements, like blue cohosh, black cohosh,
chasteberry, or DHEA
prasterone

Tell your prescriber or health care professional about all other
medicines you are taking, including non-prescription medicines,
nutritional supplements, or herbal products. Also tell your prescriber
or health care professional if you are a frequent user of drinks with
caffeine or alcohol, if you smoke, or if you use illegal drugs. These
may affect the way your medicine works. Check with your health care
professional before stopping or starting any of your medicines.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

Make sure you understand how and when to use this medicine. You need to
know when you are ovulating and when to have sexual intercourse. This
will increase the chance of a pregnancy.

Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on
your progress. You may need tests to check the hormone levels in your
blood or you may have to use home-urine tests to check for ovulation.
Try to keep any appointments.

Compared to other fertility treatments, this medicine does not greatly
increase your chances of having multiple babies. An increased chance of
having twins may occur in roughly 5 out of every 100 women who take
this medication.

Stop taking this medicine at once and contact your doctor or health
care professional if you think you are pregnant.

This medicine is not for long-term use. Most women that benefit from
this medicine do so within the first three cycles (months). Your doctor
or health care professional will monitor your condition. This medicine
is usually used for a total of 6 cycles of treatment.

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do
anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this drug
affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly. This reduces the risk of
dizzy or fainting spells.

Drinking alcoholic beverages or smoking tobacco may decrease your
chance of becoming pregnant. Limit or stop alcohol and tobacco use
during your fertility treatments.

What side effects may I notice from this medicine?

Side effects that you should report to your doctor or health care
professional as soon as possible:
allergic reactions like skin rash, itching or hives, swelling of
the face, lips, or tongue
breathing problems
changes in vision
fluid retention
nausea, vomiting
pelvic pain or bloating
severe abdominal pain
sudden weight gain

Side effects that usually do not require medical attention (report to
your doctor or health care professional if they continue or are
bothersome):
breast discomfort
hot flashes
mild pelvic discomfort
mild nausea

This list may not describe all possible side effects.

Where can I keep my medicine?

Keep out of the reach of children.

Store at room temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C (59 and 86
degrees F). Protect from heat, light, and moisture. Throw away any
unused medicine after the expiration date.

with hysterectomy and menopause women at the age of 50 years.

How should I use this medicine?

Vardenafil and Dapoxetine tablet

What is this medicine?

VARDENAFIL; DAPOXETINE is proven to help in treatment of impotence and
premature ejaculation. Antidepressants like fluoxetine have long been
used off-label to delay orgasms. The product is fairly new and became
available in early 2010.

What should my health care professional know before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
bipolar disorder or mania
diabetes
frequent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
heart disease, angina, high or low blood pressure, a history of
heart attack, or other heart problems
kidney disease
liver disease
psychosis
seizures
stroke
an unusual reaction to vardenafil, dapoxetine, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

How should I use this medicine?

Take this medicine by mouth with a glass of water. The dose is usually
taken 1-2 hours before sexual activity. You can take this medicine with
or without food. You should not take the dose more than once per day.
Do not take your medicine more often than directed. If you have been
taking this medicine regularly for some time, do not suddenly stop
taking it.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What may interact with this medicine?

Do not take this medicine with any of the following:
cisapride
methscopolamine nitrate
nitrates like amyl nitrite, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide
mononitrate, nitroglycerin
nitroprusside
other vardenafil products

This medicine may also interact with the following:
arsenic trioxide

care providers a list of all the medicines, herbs, non-prescription
drugs, or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them if you smoke,
drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. Some items may interact with your
medicine.

Currently, there are no documented drug-drug interactions associated
with dapoxetine. Pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to
determine if dapoxetine has any drug interactions with tadalafil and
sildenafil; as well as with ethanol. Both studies demonstrated no
significant interactions when the combination was administered. Due to
the lack of current information, it is too early to speak about other
potential drug interactions.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

If you notice any changes in your vision while taking this drug, call
your doctor or health care professional as soon as possible.

Contact you doctor or health care professional right away if the

upon initiation of sexual activity after taking this medicine, you
should refrain from further activity and call your doctor or health
care professional as soon as possible.

If you have diabetes, this medicine may affect blood sugar levels.
Check your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor or health care professional
if you notice changes.

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do
anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this medicine
affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an
older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.
Alcohol can make you more drowsy and dizzy. Avoid alcoholic drinks.

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy,
and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your doctor if the
problem does not go away or is severe.

Using this medicine does not protect you or your partner against HIV
infection (the virus that causes AIDS) or other sexually transmitted
diseases.

disturbance side effect.

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
b"       anatomical deformity of the penis, Peyronie's disease, or ever had n"
an erection that lasted more than 4 hours
bleeding disorder
cancer
diabetes
frequent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

high cholesterol
HIV infection
kidney disease

preservatives

How should this medicine be used?

Take vardenafil tablets by mouth with or without food. The dose is
usually taken about 1 hour before sexual activity. Swallow the tablets
with a drink of water. Do not take double or extra doses.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What if I miss a dose?

This does not apply. However, do not take double or extra doses.

nitroglycerin-type drugs for the heart or chest pain such as amyl
nitrite, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate,
nitroglycerin, even if these are only taken occasionally. This
b"       includes some recreational drugs called 'poppers' which also n"

nutritional supplements, or herbal products. Also tell your prescriber
or health care professional if you are a frequent user of drinks with
caffeine or alcohol, if you smoke, or if you use illegal drugs. These
may affect the way your medicine works. Check with your health care
professional before stopping or starting any of your medicines.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

If you notice any changes in your vision while taking this drug, notify
your prescriber or health care professional as soon as possible. Stop
using vardenafil right away if you have a loss of sight in one or both
eyes. Contact your healthcare provider immediately.

Contact your physician immediately if the erection lasts longer than 4
hours or if it becomes painful. This may be a sign of priapism and must
be treated immediately to prevent permanent damage.

If you experience symptoms of nausea, dizziness, chest pain or arm pain
upon initiation of sexual activity after vardenafil use, you should
refrain from further activity and should discuss the episode with your
prescriber or health care professional as soon as possible.

Do not change the dose of your medication. Please call your prescriber
or health care professional to determine if your dose needs to be
reevaluated.

Using vardenafil does not protect you or your partner against HIV

professional as soon as possible.

Dapoxetine tablet

What is this medicine?

DAPOXETINE has been found to be safe and effective for the treatment of
premature ejaculation, according to two major clinical trials.
Dapoxetine is a short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI).

What should my health care professional know before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
bipolar disorder or mania
diabetes
liver disease
psychosis
seizures
an unusual or allergic reaction to dapoxetine, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

How should I use this medicine?

Take this medicine by mouth with a glass of water on an as-needed basis
1 to 3 hours before sexual intercourse. You can take this medicine with
or without food.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What may interact with this medicine?

Currently, there are no documented drug-drug interactions associated
with dapoxetine. Pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to
determine if dapoxetine has any drug interactions with tadalafil and
sildenafil; as well as with ethanol. Both studies demonstrated no
significant interactions when the combination was administered. Due to
the lack of current information, it is too early to speak about other
potential drug interactions.

Give your health care providers a list of all the medicines, herbs,
non-prescription drugs, or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them
if you smoke, or use illegal drugs. Some items may interact with your
medicine.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do
anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this medicine
affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an
older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.
Alcohol can make you more drowsy and dizzy. Avoid alcoholic drinks.

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy,
and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your doctor if the
problem does not go away or is severe.

If you have diabetes, this medicine may affect blood sugar levels.
Check your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor or health care professional
if you notice changes.

If you have been taking this medicine regularly for some time, do not
suddenly stop taking it. You must gradually reduce the dose or you may
get side effects or have a worsening of your condition. Ask your doctor
or health care professional for advice.

What side effects may I notice from this medicine?

Side effects that you should report to your doctor or health care
professional as soon as possible:
allergic reactions like skin rash, itching or hives, swelling of
the face, lips, or tongue

Side effects that usually do not require medical attention (report to
your doctor or health care professional if they continue or are
bothersome):
headache
diarrhea
dry mouth
insomnia
nausea
dizziness

This list may not describe all possible side effects.

Where can I keep my medicine?

Keep out of reach of children.

Store at room temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C (59 and 86
degrees F). Do not freeze. Throw away any unused medicine after the
expiration date.

What is this medicine?

FINASTERIDE is used for the treatment of certain types of male hair

kidney disease or infection
liver disease
prostate cancer
an unusual or allergic reaction to finasteride, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

How should I take this medicine?

water. You can take this medicine with or without food. Take your doses
at regular intervals. Do not take your medicine more often than

contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What if I miss a dose?

Products

Are the medications in your list brand name pills?

All the medications one can see in our product lists are generic.

What does the term "generic" mean? Do generic medications produce the same
effect that the brand name medicines do?

The difference between a brand name medicine and a generic one is in
the name, shape, color and in the price. A generic drug is usually
called by the name of the active ingredient while a manufacturer uses a
brand name. However, a manufacturer cannot possess a patent for a
certain chemical agent, this is why manufacturers of generic
medications can legally produce the so-called "generics". They are the
same chemically and since the active ingredient is identical, they have
the same medical effect. Thus buying a generic medication one pays less
but gets the very same result.But we ought to mention that only once
you follow all the instructions of your health care provider you get
the intended effect.

Why are generic medicines so cheap?

Unlike generic drugs, a large part of the costs incurred by original
manufacturers of brand name drugs are for research and development and
advertising. The expense of obtaining FDA approval alone in the U.S. is
enormous. Manufacturers of generic drugs do not have to absorb or
recover these costs. Consequently, significant cost savings can be
passed along to you.

Your pills do not look like the brand name medication. The pills I have
received have a different name printed on them. Why?

As we have already mentioned that no manufacturer can take out a patent
for a chemical agent. Thus generics can have the e tly same active
ingredients as the brand pills. However, names and appearance (shape
and color) of medications can be and are always patented and should be
treated as the intellectual property. Thus using the name and the shape
of the brand pills a manufacturer producing generic medications will be
accused of the copyright infringement. This is why generic pills look
different, they are of a different color and have a different shape if
compared to a brand name pill.

How can I be sure in the quality of the pills you offer?

High quality of the medications we offer is the subject of our primary
concern. The logic is very simple: the better the quality of goods is,
the more customers we have. Thus we are very attentive and selective in
the choice of the supplier, the quality of goods is thoroughly tested
and the documentation is closely checked. The medications are
manufactured in India by an Indian state licensed, Indian FDA approved
company.

What is the shelf life of the pills?

The expiry date is mentioned on each blister. It is different for
different batches. The shelf life is 2 years from the date of
manufacture and would differ from batch to batch depending on when they
were manufactured.

What is the difference between 50mg Viagra tabs and 100mg tabs?

Generic Viagra we offer is available in 50mg and 100mg tabs. These are
fixed dosages of Sildenafil (the active ingredient) in the pills: thus
a 50mg Viagra pill contains 50 mg of Sildenafil concentrate and a 100mg
Viagra pill contains 100mg of Sildenafil. The standard dose for
achieving the effect is a 50mg pill. However, the ingredient effects
different people in a different way so we would recommend you to start
with 25mg (split a 50mg pill in two and take one half only) to see if
this is enough for you. If not - take a whole 50mg pill.

What is the difference between Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Soft and Regular?

Please, check the table below:
Drug Name Dosage Time before it starts to act How to take Fatty
food/alcohol Effect lasts
Viagra 50mg, 100mg 1 hour take with a glass of water no 3-4 hours
Viagra Soft 50mg, 100mg 15 - 20 minutes to be chewed until dissolved
completely no 6 hours
Cialis 20mg 30 minutes take with a glass of water no 36 hours
Cialis Soft 20mg 15 - 20 minutes to be chewed until dissolved
completely no 24 - 36 hours
Levitra 20mg 10 minutes - 1 hour take with a glass of water no 12 hours

How to Order

Should I have a prescription to order from you?

Some products available in our pharmacy require a valid prescription.

you complete the order.

Please be informed that we require a valid prescription for your order.
You should fax it to or send a scan copy to the email . Please be
b"   advised that in case you don't provide a valid prescription within a n"

We strongly recommend you to consult your physician, prior to ordering,
to be sure that the medicine you are about to order, is the one you
need.

exception of some countries in Asia.

Where the pills are sent from?

The medications are manufactured in India, thus the orders are
processed and sent out from there.

What packages do you use? Will I have to sign for the shipment?

Your privacy is very important for us. Your order will be sent in a
discrete envelope that will be left in your mail box. You will not have
to sign for it in case the order is sent by Standard Mail.

Will my order be shipped the same day I purchase?

The products we sell are in stock for immediate delivery. However we
have to check your order first to make sure that the shipping
information is correct, after that the product you have ordered is
packed and only then it is sent out. All these procedures take about
1-2 days.

What are the shipping methods? When can I expect the delivery?

Currently we offer two shipping methods:
1. Express International Mail: the packages sent by this postal
service can be tracked by the tracking number supplied after the
order is shipped. See your account section. Please, note,
however, that in some cases we reserve the right to send your order
without a tracking number but with the same delivery time as it
would be in case of Express Mail. This is done mostly in cases when
we need to secure successful delivery to European countries and
Canada.
2. Standard International Airmail: the packages sent by this postal
service can NOT be tracked.

Shipping Option         Rates  Delivery   Tracking
Express International Mail ^   $     5-9 days   tracked
Standard International Airmail $     10-21 days not tracked

^  We will not be able to send your order by Express International Mail
if you specify a mail forwarding address (e.g. PO box, General
delivery, Poste restante, UPS store, APO/FPO), hotel or educational
facility in your shipping address or if you give us a wrong telephone
number.

Please, keep in mind that the time of delivery specified here is the
estimated delivery time which is true for most cases, but cannot be
guaranteed due to the probability of force majeure events described
below.

Please, note that our company is not liable for extended delays due to

Tadalafil Chewable tablet

What is this medicine?

TADALAFIL chewable tablets are used to treat erection problems in men.
The soft tablets act faster than ordinary oral tabs and the effect is
kept as long as from regular pill.

What should I tell my health care provider before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
eye or vision problems, including a rare inherited eye disease
called retinitis pigmentosa
heart disease, angina, a history of heart attack, irregular heart
beats, or other heart problems
high or low blood pressure
kidney or liver disease
stroke
an unusual or allergic reaction to tadalafil, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

How should I use this medicine?

Cialis Soft Tabs are taken as needed 15min before sexual activity.
Because Cialis Soft Tabs are chewed, the effects typically start much
sooner than orally consumed medicines.

You should not take this dose more than once per day. Do not take your
medicine more often than directed.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What may interact with this medicine?

Do not take this medicine with any of the following medications:
nitrates like amyl nitrite, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide
mononitrate, nitroglycerin

This medicine may also interact with the following medications:
certain drugs for high blood pressure
certain drugs for the treatment of HIV infection or AIDS
certain drugs used for fungal or yeast infections, like
fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole
certain drugs used for seizures like carbamazepine, phenytoin, and
phenobarbital
grapefruit juice
macrolide antibiotics like clarithromycin, erythromycin,
troleandomycin
medicines for prostate problems
rifabutin, rifampin or rifapentine

This list may not describe all possible interactions. Give your health
care provider a list of all the medicines, herbs, non-prescription
drugs, or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them if you smoke,
drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. Some items may interact with your
medicine.

What should I watch for while using this medicine?

If you notice any changes in your vision while taking this drug, call
your doctor or health care professional as soon as possible. Stop using
this medicine and call your health care provider right away if you have
a loss of sight in one or both eyes.

Contact you doctor or health care professional right away if the
erection lasts longer than 4 hours or if it becomes painful. This may
be a sign of serious problem and must be treated right away to prevent
permanent damage.

If you experience symptoms of nausea, dizziness, chest pain or arm pain
upon initiation of sexual activity after taking this medicine, you
should refrain from further activity and call your doctor or health
care professional as soon as possible.

Do not drink alcohol to excess (examples, 5 glasses of wine or 5 shots
of whiskey) when taking this medicine. When taken in excess, alcohol
can increase your chances of getting a headache or getting dizzy,
increasing your heart rate or lowering your blood pressure.

Using this medicine does not protect you or your partner against HIV
infection (the virus that causes AIDS) or other sexually transmitted
diseases.

What side effects may I notice from this medicine?

Side effects that you should report to your doctor or health care
professional as soon as possible:
allergic reactions like skin rash, itching or hives, swelling of
the face, lips, or tongue
breathing problems
changes in hearing
chest pain
fast, irregular heartbeat

Side effects that usually do not require medical attention (report to
your doctor or health care professional if they continue or are
bothersome):
back pain
dizziness
flushing
headache
indigestion
muscle aches
stuffy or runny nose

This list may not describe all possible side effects.

Where should I keep my medicine?

Keep out of the reach of children.

Store at room temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C (59 and 86
degrees F). Throw away any unused medicine after the expiration date.

Important information

Mind that the pills you will receive from us differ in appearance from
the brand name ones. The looks of medications as well as brand names
are the intellectual property of the brand manufacturer. Thus to avoid
any accusation of copyright infringement we have to change the shape
and the color of the generic pills as well as use the name of the
active ingredient instead of the brand name for printing on pills.

Tadalafil and Dapoxetine tablet

What is this medicine?

TADALAFIL; DAPOXETINE is proven to help in treatment of impotence and
premature ejaculation. Antidepressants like fluoxetine have long been
used off-label to delay orgasms. The product is fairly new and became
available in early 2010.

What should my health care professional know before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
eye or vision problems, including a rare inherited eye disease
called retinitis pigmentosa
bipolar disorder or mania
diabetes
high or low blood pressure
frequent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
heart disease, angina, high or low blood pressure, a history of
heart attack, or other heart problems
kidney disease
liver disease
psychosis
seizures
stroke
an unusual reaction to tadalafil, dapoxetine, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

How should I use this medicine?

Take this medicine by mouth with a glass of water. The dose is usually
taken 1-2 hours before sexual activity. You can take this medicine with
or without food. You should not take the dose more than once per day.
Do not take your medicine more often than directed. If you have been
taking this medicine regularly for some time, do not suddenly stop
taking it.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What may interact with this medicine?

Do not take this medicine with any of the following:
cisapride
methscopolamine nitrate
nitrates like amyl nitrite, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide
mononitrate, nitroglycerin
nitroprusside
other tadalafil products

This medicine may also interact with the following:
arsenic trioxide
bosentan
certain drugs for high blood pressure
certain drugs for the treatment of HIV infection or AIDS
certain drugs used for fungal or yeast infections, like
fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole
chloroquine
cisapride
diltiazem
grapefruit juice
macrolide antibiotics like clarithromycin, erythromycin,
troleandomycin
medicines for prostate problems
medicines for fungal infections (fluconazole, itraconazole,
ketoconazole, voriconazole)
methadone
nicardipine
pentamidine
pimozide
rifabutin, rifampin, or rifapentine

This list may not describe all possible interactions. Give your health
care providers a list of all the medicines, herbs, non-prescription
drugs, or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them if you smoke,
drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. Some items may interact with your
medicine.

Currently, there are no documented drug-drug interactions associated
with dapoxetine. Pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to
determine if dapoxetine has any drug interactions with tadalafil and
sildenafil; as well as with ethanol. Both studies demonstrated no
significant interactions when the combination was administered. Due to
the lack of current information, it is too early to speak about other
potential drug interactions.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

If you notice any changes in your vision while taking this drug, call
your doctor or health care professional as soon as possible.

Contact you doctor or health care professional right away if the
erection lasts longer than 4 hours or if it becomes painful. This may
be a sign of a serious problem and must be treated right away to
prevent permanent damage.

If you experience symptoms of nausea, dizziness, chest pain or arm pain
upon initiation of sexual activity after taking this medicine, you
should refrain from further activity and call your doctor or health
care professional as soon as possible.

If you have diabetes, this medicine may affect blood sugar levels.
Check your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor or health care professional
if you notice changes.

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do
anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this medicine
affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an
older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.
Alcohol can make you more drowsy and dizzy. Avoid alcoholic drinks.

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy,
and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your doctor if the
problem does not go away or is severe.

Using this medicine does not protect you or your partner against HIV
infection (the virus that causes AIDS) or other sexually transmitted
diseases.

What side effects may I notice from this medicine?

professional as soon as possible:

changes in hearing
changes in vision, blurred vision, trouble telling blue from green
color

degrees F) away from heat and direct light. Do not freeze. Throw away
any unused medicine after the expiration date.

Clomiphene tablet

What is this medicine?

CLOMIPHENE is a fertility drug used to increase the chance of getting
pregnant. It is used to help women ovulate (produce a mature egg)
properly during their cycle. Compared to other fertility treatments,
clomiphene alone does not greatly increase your chances of having
multiple babies. An increased chance of having twins may occur in
roughly 5 out of every 100 women who take this medication. Occasionally
clomiphene is prescribed to men with fertility problems due to low
sperm counts.

What should my health care professional know before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
adrenal gland disease
blood vessel disease or blood clots
cyst on the ovary
endometriosis
liver disease
ovarian cancer
pituitary gland disease
vaginal bleeding that has not been evaluated
an unusual or allergic reaction to clomiphene, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives
pregnant (should not be used if you are already pregnant)
breast-feeding

How should I take this medicine?

Take this medicine by mouth with a glass of water. Take e tly as
directed for the e t number of days prescribed. Take your doses at
regular intervals. Most women take this medicine for a 5 day period,
but the length of treatment may be adjusted. Your doctor will give you
a start date for this medication and will give you instructions on
proper use. Do not take your medicine more often than directed.

Talk to your pediatrician regarding the use of this medicine in
children. Special care may be needed.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What if I miss a dose?

If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you can. If it is almost time
for your next dose, take only that dose. Do not take double or extra
doses.

What may interact with this medicine?

herbal or dietary supplements, like blue cohosh, black cohosh,
chasteberry, or DHEA
prasterone

Tell your prescriber or health care professional about all other
medicines you are taking, including non-prescription medicines,
nutritional supplements, or herbal products. Also tell your prescriber
or health care professional if you are a frequent user of drinks with
caffeine or alcohol, if you smoke, or if you use illegal drugs. These
may affect the way your medicine works. Check with your health care
professional before stopping or starting any of your medicines.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

Make sure you understand how and when to use this medicine. You need to
know when you are ovulating and when to have sexual intercourse. This
will increase the chance of a pregnancy.

Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on
your progress. You may need tests to check the hormone levels in your
blood or you may have to use home-urine tests to check for ovulation.
Try to keep any appointments.

Compared to other fertility treatments, this medicine does not greatly
increase your chances of having multiple babies. An increased chance of
having twins may occur in roughly 5 out of every 100 women who take
this medication.

Stop taking this medicine at once and contact your doctor or health
care professional if you think you are pregnant.

This medicine is not for long-term use. Most women that benefit from
this medicine do so within the first three cycles (months). Your doctor
or health care professional will monitor your condition. This medicine
is usually used for a total of 6 cycles of treatment.

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do
anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this drug
affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly. This reduces the risk of
dizzy or fainting spells.

Drinking alcoholic beverages or smoking tobacco may decrease your
chance of becoming pregnant. Limit or stop alcohol and tobacco use
during your fertility treatments.

What side effects may I notice from this medicine?

Side effects that you should report to your doctor or health care
professional as soon as possible:
allergic reactions like skin rash, itching or hives, swelling of
the face, lips, or tongue
breathing problems
changes in vision
fluid retention
nausea, vomiting
pelvic pain or bloating
severe abdominal pain
sudden weight gain

Side effects that usually do not require medical attention (report to
your doctor or health care professional if they continue or are
bothersome):
breast discomfort
hot flashes
mild pelvic discomfort
mild nausea

This list may not describe all possible side effects.

Where can I keep my medicine?

Keep out of the reach of children.

Store at room temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C (59 and 86
degrees F). Protect from heat, light, and moisture. Throw away any
unused medicine after the expiration date.

Vardenafil orally disintegrating tablet

What is this medicine?

VARDENAFIL professional has all the advantages of the regular pill.
Absorbed directly in the mouth, it acts faster. Another notable
advantage of Levitra Professional is lesser stimulation needed to
achieve an erection, as the nerves of the penis become more sensitive.
Also,Vardenafil is less likely to have visual disturbance side effect
than Sildenafil.

What should I tell my health care provider before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
b"       anatomical deformity of the penis, Peyronie's disease, or ever had n"
an erection that lasted more than 4 hours
bleeding disorder
cancer
diabetes
frequent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
heart disease, angina, high or low blood pressure, a history of
heart attack, or other heart problems
high cholesterol
HIV infection
kidney disease
liver disease
sickle cell disease
stroke
stomach or intestinal ulcers
eye or vision problems
an unusual reaction to vardenafil, medicines, foods, dyes, or
preservatives

How should this medicine be used?

Take one tablet by mouth and chew it till it dissolves. The response
period of Levitra Professional is considerably shorter than that of
regular Levitra. The dose is usually taken about 30 minutes before
sexual activity. Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of
this medicine contact a poison control center or emergency room at
once. NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine
with others.

What if I miss a dose?

This does not apply. However, do not take double or extra doses.

What may interact with this medicine?

Do not take vardenafil if you are taking the following medications:
nitroglycerin-type drugs for the heart or chest pain such as amyl
nitrite, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate,
nitroglycerin, even if these are only taken occasionally. This
b"       includes some recreational drugs called 'poppers' which also n"
contain amyl nitrate and butyl nitrate.

Vardenafil may also interact with the following medications:
alpha blockers such as alfuzosin (UroXatral), doxazosin (Cardura),
prazosin (Minipress), tamsulosin (Flomax), or terazosin (Hytrin),
used to treat high blood pressure or an enlarged prostate.

may affect the way your medicine works. Check with your health care
professional before stopping or starting any of your medicines.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

If you notice any changes in your vision while taking this drug, notify
your prescriber or health care professional as soon as possible. Stop
using vardenafil right away if you have a loss of sight in one or both
eyes. Contact your healthcare provider immediately. Contact your
physician immediately if the erection lasts longer than 4 hours or if
it becomes painful. This may be a sign of priapism and must be treated
immediately to prevent permanent damage. If you experience symptoms of
nausea, dizziness, chest pain or arm pain upon initiation of sexual
activity after vardenafil use, you should refrain from further activity
and should discuss the episode with your prescriber or health care
professional as soon as possible. Do not change the dose of your
medication. Please call your prescriber or health care professional to
determine if your dose needs to be reevaluated. Using vardenafil does
not protect you or your partner against HIV infection (the virus that
causes AIDS) or other sexually transmitted diseases.

professional as soon as possible.

Vardenafil and Dapoxetine tablet

What is this medicine?

VARDENAFIL; DAPOXETINE is proven to help in treatment of impotence and
premature ejaculation. Antidepressants like fluoxetine have long been
used off-label to delay orgasms. The product is fairly new and became
available in early 2010.

What should my health care professional know before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
bipolar disorder or mania
diabetes
frequent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
heart disease, angina, high or low blood pressure, a history of
heart attack, or other heart problems
kidney disease
liver disease
psychosis
seizures
stroke
an unusual reaction to vardenafil, dapoxetine, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

How should I use this medicine?

Take this medicine by mouth with a glass of water. The dose is usually
taken 1-2 hours before sexual activity. You can take this medicine with
or without food. You should not take the dose more than once per day.
Do not take your medicine more often than directed. If you have been
taking this medicine regularly for some time, do not suddenly stop
taking it.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What may interact with this medicine?

Do not take this medicine with any of the following:
cisapride
methscopolamine nitrate
nitrates like amyl nitrite, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide
mononitrate, nitroglycerin
nitroprusside
other vardenafil products

This medicine may also interact with the following:
arsenic trioxide
bosentan
certain drugs for high blood pressure
certain drugs for the treatment of HIV infection or AIDS
certain drugs used for fungal or yeast infections, like
fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole
chloroquine
cisapride
diltiazem
grapefruit juice
medicines for fungal infections (fluconazole, itraconazole,
ketoconazole, voriconazole)
methadone
nicardipine
pentamidine
pimozide
rifabutin, rifampin, or rifapentine

This list may not describe all possible interactions. Give your health
care providers a list of all the medicines, herbs, non-prescription
drugs, or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them if you smoke,
drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. Some items may interact with your
medicine.

Currently, there are no documented drug-drug interactions associated
with dapoxetine. Pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to
determine if dapoxetine has any drug interactions with tadalafil and
sildenafil; as well as with ethanol. Both studies demonstrated no
significant interactions when the combination was administered. Due to
the lack of current information, it is too early to speak about other
potential drug interactions.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

If you notice any changes in your vision while taking this drug, call
your doctor or health care professional as soon as possible.

Contact you doctor or health care professional right away if the
erection lasts longer than 4 hours or if it becomes painful. This may
be a sign of a serious problem and must be treated right away to
prevent permanent damage.

If you experience symptoms of nausea, dizziness, chest pain or arm pain
upon initiation of sexual activity after taking this medicine, you
should refrain from further activity and call your doctor or health
care professional as soon as possible.

If you have diabetes, this medicine may affect blood sugar levels.
Check your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor or health care professional
if you notice changes.

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do
anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this medicine
affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an
older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.
Alcohol can make you more drowsy and dizzy. Avoid alcoholic drinks.

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy,
and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your doctor if the
problem does not go away or is severe.

Using this medicine does not protect you or your partner against HIV
infection (the virus that causes AIDS) or other sexually transmitted
diseases.

What side effects may I notice from this medicine?

Side effects that you should report to your doctor or health care
professional as soon as possible:

color

any unused medicine after the expiration date.

or health care professional if you are a frequent user of drinks with
caffeine or alcohol, if you smoke, or if you use illegal drugs. These
may affect the way your medicine works. Check with your health care
professional before stopping or starting any of your medicines.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

If you notice any changes in your vision while taking this drug, notify
your prescriber or health care professional as soon as possible. Stop
using vardenafil right away if you have a loss of sight in one or both
eyes. Contact your healthcare provider immediately.

Contact your physician immediately if the erection lasts longer than 4
hours or if it becomes painful. This may be a sign of priapism and must
be treated immediately to prevent permanent damage.

refrain from further activity and should discuss the episode with your

Dapoxetine tablet

What is this medicine?

DAPOXETINE has been found to be safe and effective for the treatment of
premature ejaculation, according to two major clinical trials.
Dapoxetine is a short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI).

What should my health care professional know before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
bipolar disorder or mania
diabetes
liver disease
psychosis
seizures
an unusual or allergic reaction to dapoxetine, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

How should I use this medicine?

Take this medicine by mouth with a glass of water on an as-needed basis
1 to 3 hours before sexual intercourse. You can take this medicine with
or without food.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What may interact with this medicine?

Currently, there are no documented drug-drug interactions associated
with dapoxetine. Pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to
determine if dapoxetine has any drug interactions with tadalafil and
sildenafil; as well as with ethanol. Both studies demonstrated no
significant interactions when the combination was administered. Due to
the lack of current information, it is too early to speak about other
potential drug interactions.

Give your health care providers a list of all the medicines, herbs,
non-prescription drugs, or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them
if you smoke, or use illegal drugs. Some items may interact with your
medicine.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do
anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this medicine
affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an
older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.
Alcohol can make you more drowsy and dizzy. Avoid alcoholic drinks.

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy,
and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your doctor if the
problem does not go away or is severe.

If you have diabetes, this medicine may affect blood sugar levels.
Check your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor or health care professional
if you notice changes.

If you have been taking this medicine regularly for some time, do not
suddenly stop taking it. You must gradually reduce the dose or you may
get side effects or have a worsening of your condition. Ask your doctor
or health care professional for advice.

What side effects may I notice from this medicine?

Side effects that you should report to your doctor or health care
professional as soon as possible:
allergic reactions like skin rash, itching or hives, swelling of
the face, lips, or tongue

Side effects that usually do not require medical attention (report to
your doctor or health care professional if they continue or are
bothersome):
headache
diarrhea
dry mouth
insomnia
nausea
dizziness

This list may not describe all possible side effects.

Where can I keep my medicine?

Keep out of reach of children.

Store at room temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C (59 and 86
degrees F). Do not freeze. Throw away any unused medicine after the
expiration date.

Finasteride tablet

What is this medicine?

FINASTERIDE is used for the treatment of certain types of male hair
loss (Alopecia). Finasteride is not for use in women.

What should my health care professional know before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
if you are female (finasteride is not for use in women)
kidney disease or infection
liver disease
prostate cancer
an unusual or allergic reaction to finasteride, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

How should I take this medicine?

Take finasteride tablets by mouth. Swallow the tablets with a drink of
water. You can take this medicine with or without food. Take your doses
at regular intervals. Do not take your medicine more often than
directed.

Contact your pediatrician or health care professional regarding the use
of this medicine in children. Special care may be needed.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What if I miss a dose?

If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you can. If you do not remember
b"   until the next day, take only that day's dose. Do not take double or n"
extra doses.

What may interact with this medicine?

some blood pressure medications
male hormones (example: testosterone)
saw palmetto
soy isoflavones supplements

Tell your prescriber or health care professional about all other
medicines you are taking, including non-prescription medicines. Also
tell your prescriber or health care professional if you are a frequent
user of drinks with caffeine or alcohol, if you smoke, or if you use
illegal drugs. These may affect the way your medicine works. Check with
your health care professional before stopping or starting any of your
medicines.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

Do not donate blood until at least 6 months after your final dose of
finasteride. This will prevent giving finasteride to a pregnant female
through a blood transfusion.

Contact your prescriber or health care professional if there is no
improvement in your symptoms. You may need to take finasteride for 6 to
12 months to get the best results.

Women who are pregnant or may get pregnant must not handle broken or
crushed finasteride tablets; the active ingredient could harm the
unborn baby. If a pregnant woman comes into contact with broken or
crushed finasteride tablets she should check with her prescriber or
health care professional. Exposure to whole tablets is not expected to
cause harm as long as they are not swallowed.

Finasteride can interfere with PSA laboratory tests for prostate
cancer. If you are scheduled to have a lab test for prostate cancer,
tell your prescriber or health care professional that you are taking
finasteride.

What side effects may I notice from this medicine?

Side effects that usually do not require medical attention (report to
your prescriber or health care professional if they continue or are
bothersome):
breast enlargement or tenderness
skin rash
sexual difficulties (less sexual desire or ability to get an
erection)
small amount of semen released during sex

This list may not describe all possible side effects.

Where can I keep my medicine?

Keep out of the reach of children in a container that small children
cannot open.

Store at room temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C (59 and 86
degrees F). Protect from light. Keep container tightly closed. Throw
away any unused medicine after the expiration date.

Levothyroxine tablet

What is this medicine?

LEVOTHYROXINE is a thyroid hormone. This medicine can improve symptoms
of thyroid deficiency such as slow speech, lack of energy, weight gain,
hair loss, dry skin, and feeling cold. It also helps to treat goiter
(an enlarged thyroid gland).

What should I tell my health care provider before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
angina
diabetes
heart disease
high blood pressure
low levels of pituitary hormone
dieting or on a weight loss program
previous heart attack
an unusual or allergic reaction to levothyroxine, other thyroid
hormones, other medicines, foods, dyes, or preservatives
pregnant or trying to get pregnant

How should I take this medicine?

Take this medicine by mouth with plenty of water. It is best to take on
an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before or 2 hours after food.
Take at the same time each day. Do not take your medicine more often
than directed.

Contact your pediatrician regarding the use of this medicine in
children. While this drug may be prescribed for children and infants as
young as a few days of age for selected conditions, precautions do
apply. For infants, you may crush the tablet and place in a small
amount of (5-10 ml or 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls) of water, breast milk, or
non-soy based infant formula. Do not mix with soy-based infant formula.
Give as directed.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What if I miss a dose?

for your next dose, take only that dose. Do not take double or extra
doses.

drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. Some items may interact with your
medicine.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

Be sure to take this medicine with plenty of fluids. Some tablets may
cause choking, gagging, or difficulty swallowing from the tablet
getting stuck in your throat. Most of these problems disappear if the
medicine is taken with the right amount of water or other fluids.

You will need regular exams and occasional blood tests to check the
response to treatment. If you are receiving this medicine for an
underactive thyroid, it may be several weeks before you notice an
improvement. Check with your doctor or health care professional if your
symptoms do not improve.

It may be necessary for you to take this medicine for the rest of your
life. Do not stop using this medicine unless your doctor or health care
professional advises you to.

This medicine can affect blood sugar levels. If you have diabetes,
check your blood sugar as directed.

You may lose some of your hair when you first start treatment. With
time, this usually corrects itself.

Sildenafil Citrate Soft tablet

What is this medicine?

Sildenafil Soft tablets are equivalent to regular Sildenafil Citrate.
This medicine is also used to treat erection problems in men. Soft tabs
are absorbed directly into the bloodstream, as such, they require a
much smaller dosage to achieve the same result.

What should I tell my health care provider before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:
eye or vision problems, including a rare inherited eye disease
called retinitis pigmentosa
heart disease, angina, high or low blood pressure, a history of
heart attack, or other heart problems
kidney disease
liver disease
stroke
an unusual or allergic reaction to sildenafil, other medicines,
foods, dyes, or preservatives

How should I take this medicine?

Sildenafil Citrate soft tabs enter into the bloodstream within
approximately within 15-20 minutes. The dose is usually taken 30-45
minutes before sexual activity. For some men, a half tab is adequate to
receive the desired results.

You should never take more than one tab at any one time and not more
than once a day.

Overdosage: If you think you have taken too much of this medicine
contact a poison control center or emergency room at once.

NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not share this medicine with
others.

What may interact with this medicine?

Do not take this medicine with any of the following:
cisapride
methscopolamine nitrate
nitrates like amyl nitrite, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide
mononitrate, nitroglycerin
nitroprusside
other sildenafil products (Revatio, Sildigra, Eriacta, etc.)

This medicine may also interact with the following:
certain drugs for high blood pressure
certain drugs for the treatment of HIV infection or AIDS
certain drugs used for fungal or yeast infections, like
fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole
cimetidine
erythromycin
rifampin

This list may not describe all possible interactions. Give your health
care providers a list of all the medicines, herbs, non-prescription
drugs, or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them if you smoke,
drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. Some items may interact with your
medicine.

What should I watch for while taking this medicine?

If you notice any changes in your vision while taking this drug, call
your doctor or health care professional as soon as possible.

Call your health care provider right away if you have any change in
vision.

Contact you doctor or health care professional right away if the
erection lasts longer than 4 hours or if it becomes painful. This may
be a sign of a serious problem and must be treated right away to
prevent permanent damage.

If you experience symptoms of nausea, dizziness, chest pain or arm pain
upon initiation of sexual activity after taking this medicine, you
should refrain from further activity and call your doctor or health
care professional as soon as possible.

Using this medicine does not protect you or your partner against HIV
infection (the virus that causes AIDS) or other sexually transmitted
diseases.

What side effects may I notice from taking this medicine?

Side effects that you should report to your doctor or health care
professional as soon as possible:
allergic reactions like skin rash, itching or hives, swelling of
the face, lips, or tongue
breathing problems
changes in hearing
changes in vision, blurred vision, trouble telling blue from green
color
chest pain
fast, irregular heartbeat
men: prolonged or painful erection (lasting more than 4 hours)
seizures

Side effects that usually do not require medical attention (report to
your doctor or health care professional if they continue or are
bothersome):
diarrhea
flushing
headache
indigestion
stuffy or runny nose

This list may not describe all possible side effects

Where can I keep my medicine?

Keep out of reach of children.

Store at room temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C (59 and 86
degrees F). Throw away any unused medicine after the expiration date.

Azithromycin tablet

What is this medicine?

AZITHROMYCIN is a macrolide antibiotic that interferes with the growth
of bacterial cells. It is used to treat bacterial infections in many
different parts of the body. Azithromycin also treats sexually
transmitted vaginal or urinary tract infections caused by chlamydia. It
will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.

What should my health care professional know before I take this medicine?

They need to know if you have any of these conditions:;
kidney disease; liver disease
pneumonia
stomach problems (especially colitis)
other chronic illness; an unusual or allergic reaction to
azithromycin
other macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin), foods, dyes, or
preservatives
pregnant or trying to get pregnant
breast-feeding

How should I take this medicine?

Swallow tablets whole with a full glass of water. Azithromycin tablets
can be taken with or without food. Take your doses at regular
intervals. Do not take your medicine more often than directed. Finish
the full course prescribed by your prescriber or health care
professional even if you think your condition is better. Do not stop
b"   taking except on your prescriber''s advice. Contact your pediatrician n"
or health care professional regarding the use of this medicine in
children. Special care may be needed. Overdosage: If you think you have
taken too much of this medicine contact a poison control center or
emergency room at once. NOTE: This medicine is only for you. Do not
share this medicine with others.

What if I miss a dose?

If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you can. If it is almost time
for your next dose, take only that dose. Do not take double or extra
doses. There should be an interval of at least 12 hours between doses.

Tell your prescriber or health care professional about all other
medicines you are taking, including non-prescription medicines,
nutritional supplements, or herbal products. Also tell your prescriber
or health care professional if you are a frequent user of drinks with
caffeine or alcohol, if you smoke, or if you use illegal drugs. These
may affect the way your medicine works. Check with your health care
professional before stopping or starting any of your medicines.

Products

Are the medications in your list brand name pills?

All the medications one can see in our product lists are generic.

What does the term "generic" mean? Do generic medications produce the same
effect that the brand name medicines do?

The difference between a brand name medicine and a generic one is in
the name, shape, color and in the price. A generic drug is usually
called by the name of the active ingredient while a manufacturer uses a
brand name. However, a manufacturer cannot possess a patent for a
certain chemical agent, this is why manufacturers of generic
medications can legally produce the so-called "generics". They are the
same chemically and since the active ingredient is identical, they have
the same medical effect. Thus buying a generic medication one pays less
but gets the very same result.But we ought to mention that only once
you follow all the instructions of your health care provider you get
the intended effect.

Why are generic medicines so cheap?

Unlike generic drugs, a large part of the costs incurred by original
manufacturers of brand name drugs are for research and development and
advertising. The expense of obtaining FDA approval alone in the U.S. is
enormous. Manufacturers of generic drugs do not have to absorb or
recover these costs. Consequently, significant cost savings can be
passed along to you.

Your pills do not look like the brand name medication. The pills I have
received have a different name printed on them. Why?

As we have already mentioned that no manufacturer can take out a patent
for a chemical agent. Thus generics can have the e tly same active
ingredients as the brand pills. However, names and appearance (shape
and color) of medications can be and are always patented and should be
treated as the intellectual property. Thus using the name and the shape
of the brand pills a manufacturer producing generic medications will be
accused of the copyright infringement. This is why generic pills look
different, they are of a different color and have a different shape if
compared to a brand name pill.

How can I be sure in the quality of the pills you offer?

High quality of the medications we offer is the subject of our primary
concern. The logic is very simple: the better the quality of goods is,
the more customers we have. Thus we are very attentive and selective in
the choice of the supplier, the quality of goods is thoroughly tested
and the documentation is closely checked. The medications are
manufactured in India by an Indian state licensed, Indian FDA approved
company.

What is the shelf life of the pills?

The expiry date is mentioned on each blister. It is different for
different batches. The shelf life is 2 years from the date of
manufacture and would differ from batch to batch depending on when they
were manufactured.

What is the difference between 50mg Viagra tabs and 100mg tabs?

Generic Viagra we offer is available in 50mg and 100mg tabs. These are
fixed dosages of Sildenafil (the active ingredient) in the pills: thus
a 50mg Viagra pill contains 50 mg of Sildenafil concentrate and a 100mg
Viagra pill contains 100mg of Sildenafil. The standard dose for
achieving the effect is a 50mg pill. However, the ingredient effects
different people in a different way so we would recommend you to start
with 25mg (split a 50mg pill in two and take one half only) to see if
this is enough for you. If not - take a whole 50mg pill.

What is the difference between Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Soft and Regular?

Please, check the table below:
Drug Name Dosage Time before it starts to act How to take Fatty
food/alcohol Effect lasts
Viagra 50mg, 100mg 1 hour take with a glass of water no 3-4 hours
Viagra Soft 50mg, 100mg 15 - 20 minutes to be chewed until dissolved
completely no 6 hours
Cialis 20mg 30 minutes take with a glass of water no 36 hours
Cialis Soft 20mg 15 - 20 minutes to be chewed until dissolved
completely no 24 - 36 hours
Levitra 20mg 10 minutes - 1 hour take with a glass of water no 12 hours

How to Order

Should I have a prescription to order from you?

to be sure that the medicine you are about to order, is the one you

order is shipped. See your  17654 account section. Please, note,
however, that in some cases we reserve the right to send your order
without a tracking number but with the same delivery time as it
would be in case of Express Mail. This is done mostly in cases when
we need to secure successful delivery to European countries and
Canada.
2. Standard International Airmail: the packages sent by this postal
service can NOT be tracked.

Shipping Option         Rates  Delivery   Tracking
Express International Mail ^   $     5-9 days   tracked

delivery, Poste restante, UPS store, APO/FPO), hotel or educational
facility in your shipping address or if you give us a wrong telephone
number.

estimated delivery time which is true for most cases, but cannot be
guaranteed due to the probability of force majeure events described
below.

the customs inspections of international mail.

disruptions during the Christmas and New Year celebration, natural
disasters, strikes and other events which disrupt mailing process being

) to qualify for a refund. Your payment will be fully reimbursed to
your credit card. The refund procedure usually takes 5-7 business days,
after this period the refund will be reflected at your credit card
statement.

returns. No one can guarantee that the storage conditions are met
during the order transportation thus we cannot accept them even if the

Thanks - DN
Dear Sir,
The order placed on the 19-05-2006 was delivered within 7 days, a
most impressive service. Be assured that when I decide to place
further orders I will contact you again, and will inform my friends
of your excellent service.
Many thanks - Brian
Your email was addressed as a survey and the only link was the one
I am responding to now.
To question  1; Did I receive the medication shipment as ordered?
The answer is yes, and I was impressed with the time in which it
was delivered to my home; only 10 days!
To question  2; did the medication meet my expectations?
Again the answer is yes! I was also impressed with your website
which explains everything about ordering outside the U.S., quality
of the medication made at the India labs, number(s) to call if the
shipment is held up in Customs, and the ease in placing the order.
- Dave
Good Morning:
The generic V is as expected, makes a good thing better, and the
price is such that it is used all the time. Eliminates performance
anxiety !
Thank you for your help. - Sincerely, Steve
Hi.

Best regards... and happy St Patricks from the Irish in France.. -
Kieran
Hi Thanks,
the order arrived last week no problems, the effect well.......
very busy now with my girlfriends. - Thanks
I already received my parcel, I had a problem as the courier wanted
to deliver to my home as they claim they cannot place the order
into my postbox. This was my preferred option.
There is not someone at home always, so we had to get the parcel to
my office. No problem with that.
I did have an enquiry into the 4 extra pills, and this was
delivered within a few days via airmail to my post box.
I would suggest you attend to this part of your process as the
extra cost is unnecessary. Include everything into one parcel.
All in all, good service. - Jan
Hi. thank you for sending the cialis I have received the ten pills
you you sent and have tried them. They seem too work very well so
if you would still like to send the balance of the order in cialis
I would appreciate it. And thank you once again for all your help.
It would be nice if there were more companys with customer support
team as helpful as yours. Thanks again - Ken.
Well, I must apologize - I thought surely you were scamming me.
But, all of a sudden, my mailbox overflows. I received one order on
Thursday, 8 June, and then another on Saturday, 10 June. Almost 1
month from our first effort, but the postal service must be the
culprits. With this double supply, you are now going to have to
b"       send me a couple of women, so the meds don't go to waste. How can n"
we make this right? What would you like me to do? Thanks. I hope
only good karma comes to you. - Curt

MAN, i went thru those 30 tablets like nothing, WHEW, they were
great. I could really use the other 60. I have to say your pills
are one of the better generic viagras I have expereienced so far on
my comeback trail. do you offer the the much quicker and more
flavorful melt tabs. if you do, I would like to possibly upgrade on
the remaining 60 (if they have not been shipped yet) It all depends
on the price difference, just let me know. maybe we can work
something out. - glenn
You guys were superb and true to your word, happy to be a reference
for you any time and thank you - David
Excellent! I was able to purchase, do the task, and accomplished my
time sensitive objective. Thank You very much. I have recommended
your site to my fellow workers & partners. - Sincerely, CARLOS

b"       I'm very pleased with the delivery. I have not tried the product n"
yet but will soon. If it is as good as your delivery I will be most
happy and you will have a customer for a very long time. - Thank

Thank you very much for your quick delivery. I already received my
order about one week before. Thank you very much again for your
kindly corporation. Best regards - Yukio
Yes I received the order.. It was a good deal . 60 pills for   $119.
Is this offer still in place?? - Thanks!
I though the soft tabs would be strips that melted under your
tongue. They are as you know just as hard as hard cialis however
dissolve under the tongue in about 20 mins. The flavor is fine.
Thanks for getting back to me, - Alan
Thank you. I have received my product with no problems and am very
pleased of the bonus. Thank you once again. Shall be ordering in a
few weeks.
I recieved the order just fine. They work Great. - Thanks, Larry

with you. - Best wishes Mario
Thank you VERY much for your kind email, which explains everything.
And for your continued good service, which has - frankly - saved my
relationship with the woman I love.
Thanks very much for your kind email. I have been very very
satisfied with your service and products - indeed, they have saved
my relationship, after serious psot-trauamtic disorder after long
periods serving in the wars in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq.
It was perfect as expected and faster than i thought.
Yes, I received my order and it was much more descrete than getting
it by certified mail. You have the best system.
We have received both parts of the shipment, and my husband and I
are very satisfied with the product.
b"       Hello , today i've received the package . All is ok . Thank You n"
b"       very much . I'm glad to work with You . n"
I recently placed an order with your company for some viagra and

Just to inform you that your package was received Friday 27 th
October 14 days after dispatch , excellent service , no problems

b"       Everything is fine - thnxs for good service and hope we'll meet on n"
line again.
b"       I have rec'd the order, and was pleased with every aspect of the n"
order. I do look forward to ordering in the future, so could you

Thank you for your mail. Yes, I received my order and everithing is
fine with it. Thank you very much for the four extra pills you had,
I really do appreciate it. I should recommand your site to friends
b"       and I'll come back to you soon. n"
b"       Just wanted to write and say that I'm VERY satisfied with my n"
purchase. I was skeptical at first, the price seemed too good and
the shipping process too convoluted. But I sucked it up and took
the plunge, ordered 90 of the lil blue guys and sat back to wait
for packages that might never come. Happily I was SO wrong! 9 days
after my order was placed I received my first batch of 304, and
just today (another week later) I received the remaining 60. The
b"       quality of the product is outstanding. If you  're sitting there, n"
wondering whether or not you should go ahead and make a purchase
here, quit wondering! The best prices, excellent service, and a
top-notch product are all present here. Go for it!
thank you, i recieved my pills within one week of ordering them,
cheers for the extra 4 you threw in as a bonus, and yes they worked
great, cheers again.....
b"       Shipment rec'd in good shape. Delivery was on time. Thanks for the n"
free samples. Looking forward to order more in the future.
Thanks again.
Great service ......very fast .......thanks !
I received both packets a few weeks ago and I am very pleased with
the service. Thank you for the extra 4 samples. When dealing with
people so far away, and through the internet, I sometimes wonder if
I will even receive anything for my money. I would not hesitate to
use your services again or to recommend you to friends. Again,
Thank You.
You guys and gals are wonderful!! More support than I would have
b"       expected from any of the big companies. I'll come to you first for n"
my next order.
The Viagra works just fine - straight up satisfied!
Hi,
I have received all items in my order in two shipments just as you
stated.
Thank you very much the pills work just fine.
If I want more pills how do I contact you. Let me know. - Henry
b"       Thank you for the complimentary pack of Sildenafil Citrate I'll be n"
sure to put them to good use.
Delivery was successful.
Thank you about the gifting extrapack you promised.
b"       It's a pleasure to work with you, and I'll get business with you n"
next times.
Thank you overall. - Best regards
I have received all of my order plus the bonus pills. You not only
met my expectations but greatly exceeded them!
You properly set my expectations by providing me all the
information that I would need during the ordering process and then
followed up regularly to insure that all was occurring as it
should.
Your focus on customer service is outstanding and has won me over
as a long time customer. I have already recommended you to two of
my friends and will continue to do so in the future. I am also very
pleased with the quality of your product and accompanying reference
materials that I received with my order.
I will do all of my medical business through your firm from this
point forward. Thank you for your proactive efforts and strong
customer focused business practices. I can honestly say my purchase
experience has been outstanding! - Sincerely, Lloyd
You guys are excellent. Please accept my blessing to your business.
)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
I have used viagra before and tried your generic brand and is the
same. Except yours cost a lot less. Am very happy and will buy
again From softcock to hardcock in 20 minutes what can be better
than that ! - thank you chris
I appreciate your personalized customer service and prompt follow
up. All I can say is this, if you are this straight forward and
direct when something goes wrong, then you treat your customers
with respect. And if you do that on a regular basis, you deserve to
have great things happen to you in the future.
I will be in touch.
Thanks.
I just recently arrived home from a long road trip and found that
my order was here safe and secure, right on schedule, with a 4 pill
"bonus"!! A little note ensued thanking me for my order and I just
wanted to say thank you for your generosity and professionalism. I
was a bit wary of ordering from an online pharmacy, especially
overseas....but I came to be extremely happy with the service and
the product. My sex life is back!!! I will absolutely place any and
all future orders through your site. - Best Regards, Eric
Thank-you for your service, everything has arrived without any
hiccups
your shipment arrived this morning, tnks i am very happy with your
reliable service.
I received a partial shipment yesterday.
The pills have always worked very well...as expected.
b"       That's why I ordered from you again this year...just like last n"
year.
In fact, yours work better than the 50 mg brand name pills I still
have!!
An since your pills are scored (unlike the brand name ones that I
have to use a knife to split), I can easily lower the dosage to 25
mg...which is all I need.
Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price!
You have been fabulous to work with and I will clearly recommend
your service and use it again myself.
Thank you for your great service. I have received it and it is
everything you said it would be. I will recommend your site to my
friends. Thank you once again.
Yes! I have received the order and I am extremely pleased with the
service and the pills. I had previously been paying a very high
price through prescriptions from my local GP. I am now able to
order online without hassle and delivery has been within the stated
period that you give. Many thanks!
Yes, thankyou, I have recieved the order. It arrived barely a week
after I placed it, so your logistics is working smoothly. Thank you
very much for a swift handling :)
Regarding the effect: I do notice an increase in bloodflow and a
better stamina using the pills (I use 50mg). A side-effect I have
noticed is that my nose clogs up so I seem like I have a cold for
an hour or so after taking one pill. No other side-effects than
that.
Many thanks, yes I have received my full order. I have used other
internet suppliers but you are the best of the best ! Thank you
again for a brilliant product & service. - Kindest regards, Rod

my relationship, after serious psot-trauamtic disorder after long
periods serving in the wars in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq.
It was perfect as expected and faster than i thought.
Yes, I received my order and it was much more descrete than getting
it by certified mail. You have the best system.
We have received both parts of the shipment, and my husband and I
are very satisfied with the product.
b"       Hello , today i've received the package . All is ok . Thank You n"
b"       very much . I'm glad to work with You . n"

October 14 days after dispatch , excellent service , no problems

I really do appreciate it. I should recommand your site to friends
b"       and I'll come back to you soon. n"
b"       Just wanted to write and say that I'm VERY satisfied with my n"
purchase. I was skeptical at first, the price seemed too good and
the shipping process too convoluted. But I sucked it up and took
the plunge, ordered 90 of the lil blue guys and sat back to wait
for packages that might never come. Happily I was SO wrong! 9 days
after my order was placed I received my first batch of 304, and
just today (another week later) I received the remaining 60. The
b"       quality of the product is outstanding. If you  're sitting there, n"
wondering whether or not you should go ahead and make a purchase
here, quit wondering! The best prices, excellent service, and a
top-notch product are all present here. Go for it!
thank you, i recieved my pills within one week of ordering them,
cheers for the extra 4 you threw in as a bonus, and yes they worked
great, cheers again.....
b"       Shipment rec'd in good shape. Delivery was on time. Thanks for the n"
free samples. Looking forward to order more in the future.
Thanks again.
Great service ......very fast .......thanks !
I received both packets a few weeks ago and I am very pleased with
the service. Thank you for the extra 4 samples. When dealing with
people so far away, and through the internet, I sometimes wonder if
I will even receive anything for my money. I would not hesitate to
use your services again or to recommend you to friends. Again,
Thank You.
You guys and gals are wonderful!! More support than I would have
b"       expected from any of the big companies. I'll come to you first for n"
my next order.
The Viagra works just fine - straight up satisfied!
Hi,

stated.

sure to put them to good use.
Delivery was successful.
Thank you about the gifting extrapack you promised.
b"       It's a pleasure to work with you, and I'll get business with you n"
next times.

I have received all of my order plus the bonus pills. You not only
met my expectations but greatly exceeded them!
You properly set my expectations by providing me all the
information that I would need during the ordering process and then
followed up regularly to insure that all was occurring as it
should.
Your focus on customer service is outstanding and has won me over
as a long time customer. I have already recommended you to two of
my friends and will continue to do so in the future. I am also very
pleased with the quality of your product and accompanying reference
materials that I received with my order.
I will do all of my medical business through your firm from this
point forward. Thank you for your proactive efforts and strong
customer focused business practices. I can honestly say my purchase
experience has been outstanding! - Sincerely, Lloyd
You guys are excellent. Please accept my blessing to your business.
)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
I have used viagra before and tried your generic brand and is the
same. Except yours cost a lot less. Am very happy and will buy
again From softcock to hardcock in 20 minutes what can be better
than that ! - thank you chris
I appreciate your personalized customer service and prompt follow
up. All I can say is this, if you are this straight forward and
direct when something goes wrong, then you treat your customers
with respect. And if you do that on a regular basis, you deserve to
have great things happen to you in the future.
I will be in touch.
Thanks.
I just recently arrived home from a long road trip and found that
my order was here safe and secure, right on schedule, with a 4 pill
"bonus"!! A little note ensued thanking me for my order and I just
wanted to say thank you for your generosity and professionalism. I
was a bit wary of ordering from an online pharmacy, especially
overseas....but I came to be extremely happy with the service and
the product. My sex life is back!!! I will absolutely place any and
all future orders through your site. - Best Regards, Eric
Thank-you for your service, everything has arrived without any
hiccups
your shipment arrived this morning, tnks i am very happy with your
reliable service.
I received a partial shipment yesterday.
The pills have always worked very well...as expected.
b"       That's why I ordered from you again this year...just like last n"
year.
In fact, yours work better than the 50 mg brand name pills I still
have!!
An since your pills are scored (unlike the brand name ones that I
have to use a knife to split), I can easily lower the dosage to 25
mg...which is all I need.
Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price!
You have been fabulous to work with and I will clearly recommend
your service and use it again myself.
Thank you for your great service. I have received it and it is
everything you said it would be. I will recommend your site to my
friends. Thank you once again.
Yes! I have received the order and I am extremely pleased with the
service and the pills. I had previously been paying a very high
price through prescriptions from my local GP. I am now able to
order online without hassle and delivery has been within the stated
period that you give. Many thanks!
Yes, thankyou, I have recieved the order. It arrived barely a week
after I placed it, so your logistics is working smoothly. Thank you
very much for a swift handling :)
Regarding the effect: I do notice an increase in bloodflow and a
better stamina using the pills (I use 50mg). A side-effect I have
noticed is that my nose clogs up so I seem like I have a cold for
an hour or so after taking one pill. No other side-effects than
that.
Many thanks, yes I have received my full order. I have used other
internet suppliers but you are the best of the best ! Thank you
again for a brilliant product & service. - Kindest regards, Rod

are the intellectual property of the brand manufacturer. Thus to avoid
any accusation of copyright infringement we have to change the shape
and the color of the generic pills as well as use the name of the

Refund Policy

The medications we offer are generically equivalent to their brand-name
counterparts. We guarantee that they are the same chemically and have
the same medical effect.

In case you are not satisfied with the effect our medications produce,
please  36187 contact us to inform of the problem. We will supply you

returns department, we will start the refund procedure.

Before contacting us, please, make sure that you take the right dosage
of the products and follow the instructions for use. Mind that the

In case of non-delivery of the product by the dead line (the delivery
takes 10-17 days, there may be an additional delay for 5 days for the
customs checking) you can contact our support team (  36188 Contact us
) to qualify for a refund. Your payment will be fully reimbursed to
your credit card. The refund procedure usually takes 5-7 business days,
after this period the refund will be reflected at your credit card
statement.

Due to the specific nature of products we offer we do not accept
returns. No one can guarantee that the storage conditions are met
during the order transportation thus we cannot accept them even if the
package remains unopened.

opportunity to try them. I am very happy, so is my girlfriend.
Thanks - DN
Dear Sir,
The order placed on the 19-05-2006 was delivered within 7 days, a
most impressive service. Be assured that when I decide to place
further orders I will contact you again, and will inform my friends
of your excellent service.
Many thanks - Brian
Your email was addressed as a survey and the only link was the one
I am responding to now.
To question  1; Did I receive the medication shipment as ordered?
The answer is yes, and I was impressed with the time in which it
was delivered to my home; only 10 days!
To question  2; did the medication meet my expectations?
Again the answer is yes! I was also impressed with your website
which explains everything about ordering outside the U.S., quality
of the medication made at the India labs, number(s) to call if the
shipment is held up in Customs, and the ease in placing the order.
- Dave
Good Morning:
The generic V is as expected, makes a good thing better, and the
price is such that it is used all the time. Eliminates performance
anxiety !
Thank you for your help. - Sincerely, Steve
Hi.
just want to say thanks for your promt and efficient service.. The
tablets arrived well within the timeframe given.. Have passed on
your address, dont know wheather its been used or not..
Best regards... and happy St Patricks from the Irish in France.. -
Kieran
Hi Thanks,
the order arrived last week no problems, the effect well.......
very busy now with my girlfriends. - Thanks
I already received my parcel, I had a problem as the courier wanted
to deliver to my home as they claim they cannot place the order
into my postbox. This was my preferred option.
There is not someone at home always, so we had to get the parcel to
my office. No problem with that.
I did have an enquiry into the 4 extra pills, and this was
delivered within a few days via airmail to my post box.
I would suggest you attend to this part of your process as the
extra cost is unnecessary. Include everything into one parcel.
All in all, good service. - Jan
Hi. thank you for sending the cialis I have received the ten pills
you you sent and have tried them. They seem too work very well so
if you would still like to send the balance of the order in cialis
I would appreciate it. And thank you once again for all your help.
It would be nice if there were more companys with customer support
team as helpful as yours. Thanks again - Ken.
Well, I must apologize - I thought surely you were scamming me.
But, all of a sudden, my mailbox overflows. I received one order on
Thursday, 8 June, and then another on Saturday, 10 June. Almost 1
month from our first effort, but the postal service must be the
culprits. With this double supply, you are now going to have to
b"       send me a couple of women, so the meds don't go to waste. How can n"
we make this right? What would you like me to do? Thanks. I hope
only good karma comes to you. - Curt

MAN, i went thru those 30 tablets like nothing, WHEW, they were
great. I could really use the other 60. I have to say your pills
are one of the better generic viagras I have expereienced so far on
my comeback trail. do you offer the the much quicker and more
flavorful melt tabs. if you do, I would like to possibly upgrade on
the remaining 60 (if they have not been shipped yet) It all depends
on the price difference, just let me know. maybe we can work
something out. - glenn
You guys were superb and true to your word, happy to be a reference
for you any time and thank you - David

time sensitive objective. Thank You very much. I have recommended

order about one week before. Thank you very much again for your
kindly corporation. Best regards - Yukio
Yes I received the order.. It was a good deal . 60 pills for   $119.
Is this offer still in place?? - Thanks!
I though the soft tabs would be strips that melted under your
tongue. They are as you know just as hard as hard cialis however
dissolve under the tongue in about 20 mins. The flavor is fine.
Thanks for getting back to me, - Alan
Thank you. I have received my product with no problems and am very

my relationship, after serious psot-trauamtic disorder after long
periods serving in the wars in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Thank you for your mail. Yes, I received my order and everithing is
fine with it. Thank you very much for the four extra pills you had,
I really do appreciate it. I should recommand your site to friends
b"       and I'll come back to you soon. n"
b"       Just wanted to write and say that I'm VERY satisfied with my n"
purchase. I was skeptical at first, the price seemed too good and
the shipping process too convoluted. But I sucked it up and took
the plunge, ordered 90 of the lil blue guys and sat back to wait
for packages that might never come. Happily I was SO wrong! 9 days
after my order was placed I received my first batch of 304, and
just today (another week later) I received the remaining 60. The
b"       quality of the product is outstanding. If you  're sitting there, n"
wondering whether or not you should go ahead and make a purchase
here, quit wondering! The best prices, excellent service, and a
top-notch product are all present here. Go for it!
thank you, i recieved my pills within one week of ordering them,
cheers for the extra 4 you threw in as a bonus, and yes they worked
great, cheers again.....
b"       Shipment rec'd in good shape. Delivery was on time. Thanks for the n"
free samples. Looking forward to order more in the future.
Thanks again.
Great service ......very fast .......thanks !
I received both packets a few weeks ago and I am very pleased with
the service. Thank you for the extra 4 samples. When dealing with
people so far away, and through the internet, I sometimes wonder if
I will even receive anything for my money. I would not hesitate to
use your services again or to recommend you to friends. Again,
Thank You.
You guys and gals are wonderful!! More support than I would have
b"       expected from any of the big companies. I'll come to you first for n"
my next order.
The Viagra works just fine - straight up satisfied!
Hi,

sure to put them to good use.
Delivery was successful.

b"       It's a pleasure to work with you, and I'll get business with you n"

I have received all of my order plus the bonus pills. You not only
met my expectations but greatly exceeded them!
You properly set my expectations by providing me all the
information that I would need during the ordering process and then
followed up regularly to insure that all was occurring as it
should.
Your focus on customer service is outstanding and has won me over
as a long time customer. I have already recommended you to two of
my friends and will continue to do so in the future. I am also very
pleased with the quality of your product and accompanying reference
materials that I received with my order.
I will do all of my medical business through your firm from this
point forward. Thank you for your proactive efforts and strong
customer focused business practices. I can honestly say my purchase
experience has been outstanding! - Sincerely, Lloyd
You guys are excellent. Please accept my blessing to your business.
)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
I have used viagra before and tried your generic brand and is the
same. Except yours cost a lot less. Am very happy and will buy
again From softcock to hardcock in 20 minutes what can be better
than that ! - thank you chris
I appreciate your personalized customer service and prompt follow
up. All I can say is this, if you are this straight forward and
direct when something goes wrong, then you treat your customers
with respect. And if you do that on a regular basis, you deserve to
have great things happen to you in the future.
I will be in touch.
Thanks.
I just recently arrived home from a long road trip and found that
my order was here safe and secure, right on schedule, with a 4 pill
"bonus"!! A little note ensued thanking me for my order and I just
wanted to say thank you for your generosity and professionalism. I
was a bit wary of ordering from an online pharmacy, especially
overseas....but I came to be extremely happy with the service and
the product. My sex life is back!!! I will absolutely place any and
all future orders through your site. - Best Regards, Eric
Thank-you for your service, everything has arrived without any
hiccups
your shipment arrived this morning, tnks i am very happy with your
reliable service.
I received a partial shipment yesterday.
The pills have always worked very well...as expected.
b"       That's why I ordered from you again this year...just like last n"
year.
In fact, yours work better than the 50 mg brand name pills I still
have!!
An since your pills are scored (unlike the brand name ones that I
have to use a knife to split), I can easily lower the dosage to 25
mg...which is all I need.
Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price!
You have been fabulous to work with and I will clearly recommend
your service and use it again myself.
Thank you for your great service. I have received it and it is
everything you said it would be. I will recommend your site to my
friends. Thank you once again.
Yes! I have received the order and I am extremely pleased with the
service and the pills. I had previously been paying a very high
price through prescriptions from my local GP. I am now able to
order online without hassle and delivery has been within the stated
period that you give. Many thanks!
Yes, thankyou, I have recieved the order. It arrived barely a week
after I placed it, so your logistics is working smoothly. Thank you
very much for a swift handling :)
Regarding the effect: I do notice an increase in bloodflow and a
better stamina using the pills (I use 50mg). A side-effect I have
noticed is that my nose clogs up so I seem like I have a cold for
an hour or so after taking one pill. No other side-effects than
that.
Many thanks, yes I have received my full order. I have used other
internet suppliers but you are the best of the best ! Thank you
again for a brilliant product & service. - Kindest regards, Rod

Very Inpressed with the time of Delivery - Mike
Thank you for your follow up, I did receive the pills and had an
opportunity to try them. I am very happy, so is my girlfriend.
Thanks - DN
Dear Sir,
The order placed on the 19-05-2006 was delivered within 7 days, a
most impressive service. Be assured that when I decide to place
further orders I will contact you again, and will inform my friends
of your excellent service.
Many thanks - Brian
Your email was addressed as a survey and the only link was the one
I am responding to now.
To question  1; Did I receive the medication shipment as ordered?
The answer is yes, and I was impressed with the time in which it
was delivered to my home; only 10 days!
To question  2; did the medication meet my expectations?
Again the answer is yes! I was also impressed with your website
which explains everything about ordering outside the U.S., quality
of the medication made at the India labs, number(s) to call if the
shipment is held up in Customs, and the ease in placing the order.
- Dave
Good Morning:
The generic V is as expected, makes a good thing better, and the
price is such that it is used all the time. Eliminates performance
anxiety !
Thank you for your help. - Sincerely, Steve
Hi.
just want to say thanks for your promt and efficient service.. The
tablets arrived well within the timeframe given.. Have passed on
your address, dont know wheather its been used or not..
Best regards... and happy St Patricks from the Irish in France.. -
Kieran
Hi Thanks,
the order arrived last week no problems, the effect well.......
very busy now with my girlfriends. - Thanks
I already received my parcel, I had a problem as the courier wanted
to deliver to my home as they claim they cannot place the order
into my postbox. This was my preferred option.
There is not someone at home always, so we had to get the parcel to
my office. No problem with that.
I did have an enquiry into the 4 extra pills, and this was
delivered within a few days via airmail to my post box.
I would suggest you attend to this part of your process as the
extra cost is unnecessary. Include everything into one parcel.
All in all, good service. - Jan
Hi. thank you for sending the cialis I have received the ten pills
you you sent and have tried them. They seem too work very well so
if you would still like to send the balance of the order in cialis
I would appreciate it. And thank you once again for all your help.
It would be nice if there were more companys with customer support
team as helpful as yours. Thanks again - Ken.
Well, I must apologize - I thought surely you were scamming me.
But, all of a sudden, my mailbox overflows. I received one order on
Thursday, 8 June, and then another on Saturday, 10 June. Almost 1
month from our first effort, but the postal service must be the
culprits. With this double supply, you are now going to have to
b"       send me a couple of women, so the meds don't go to waste. How can n"
we make this right? What would you like me to do? Thanks. I hope
only good karma comes to you. - Curt
GOOD Day!!

MAN, i went thru those 30 tablets like nothing, WHEW, they were
great. I could really use the other 60. I have to say your pills
are one of the better generic viagras I have expereienced so far on
my comeback trail. do you offer the the much quicker and more
flavorful melt tabs. if you do, I would like to possibly upgrade on
the remaining 60 (if they have not been shipped yet) It all depends
on the price difference, just let me know. maybe we can work
something out. - glenn
You guys were superb and true to your word, happy to be a reference
for you any time and thank you - David
Excellent! I was able to purchase, do the task, and accomplished my
time sensitive objective. Thank You very much. I have recommended
your site to my fellow workers & partners. - Sincerely, CARLOS

b"       I'm very pleased with the delivery. I have not tried the product n"
yet but will soon. If it is as good as your delivery I will be most
happy and you will have a customer for a very long time. - Thank
you
Thank you very much for your quick delivery. I already received my
order about one week before. Thank you very much again for your
kindly corporation. Best regards - Yukio
Yes I received the order.. It was a good deal . 60 pills for   $119.
Is this offer still in place?? - Thanks!
I though the soft tabs would be strips that melted under your
tongue. They are as you know just as hard as hard cialis however
dissolve under the tongue in about 20 mins. The flavor is fine.
Thanks for getting back to me, - Alan
Thank you. I have received my product with no problems and am very
pleased of the bonus. Thank you once again. Shall be ordering in a
few weeks.

Thanks very much for your kind email. I have been very very
satisfied with your service and products - indeed, they have saved
my relationship, after serious psot-trauamtic disorder after long
periods serving in the wars in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq.
It was perfect as expected and faster than i thought.

are very satisfied with the product.
