\section{Introduction}

Omri

-- darknet has much illegal activity (https://www.profwoodward.org/2016/02/how-much-of-tor-is-used-for-illegal.html). people use it because it's easier to be anonymous, hard to track etc.

-- scalably monitoring activity in darknet uses NLP tools, but little is known about what characteristics the text in Tor has, and how well do off-the-shelf NLP tools do on this domain.

-- X et al. (2017) published a corpus and looked into text classification on texts from Tor, and Y et al. (2019) looked into how influential criminal sites are. 

-- We investigate how legal and illegal activity taken from DarkNet is different, comparing to a clearnet website with similar content as a control condition.

-- We also explore methods for classifying texts from DarkNet into legal and illegal. This is important both for understanding whether these two types are different in terms of
their text and in what ways, and as a practical tool.

-- A bit on the experiments and results.

\paragraph{Detecting illegal activities in the Web}

The detection of illegal activities in the Web is sometimes derived from a more general topic classification. For example, \citet{Biryukov14} used the software Mallet \citep{McCallum02} and the web service uClassify \citep{Kagstrom13} for a classification of the content of Tor hidden services into 18 categories, which allows the distinction between illegal or contreversial content on one hand and human rights or freedom of speech content on the other hand. \citet{GraczykKinningham15} combined unsupervised feature selection and an SVM classfier for the classification of drug sales in an anonymous marketplace. However, although the detection of illegal activities can be easily deduced in some cases, the legal status of a given product can change \citep{GraczykKinningham15} and a given topic could cover both legal and illegal content \citep{AlNabki17,Avarikioti18}.

\section{Discussion}

The legal and illegal are pretty distant, which is evident in a few ways: word distribution is different, NER and Wikification work less well
for illegal. This has practical implications: we need to adapt our tools to deal with illegal Tor data. 

Looking at specific sentences, we see that it's hard distinguishing them based on the identity of the words, which means that
looking at the wordforms is a very poor solution for tackling this. However, using modern text classification, they can be distinguished
in a 72\%. 

Looking at how different types of language influence results: given that replacing all words with their POS tags gives
the same performance, this tells us their syntax is different as well.

Methological: Legal and illegal in Onion are distinct enough to be considered different domains (as distant as Legal and Ebay). 
Therefore, Tor could be a good testbed for working on legal and illegal classification.
