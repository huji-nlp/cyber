\section{Discussion}

The legal and illegal are pretty distant, which is evident in a few ways: word distribution is different, NER and Wikification work less well
for illegal. This has practical implications: we need to adapt our tools to deal with illegal Tor data. 

Looking at specific sentences, we see that it's hard distinguishing them based on the identity of the words, which means that
looking at the wordforms is a very poor solution for tackling this. However, using modern text classification, they can be distinguished
in a 72\%. 

Looking at how different types of language influence results: given that replacing all words with their POS tags gives
the same performance, this tells us their syntax is different as well.

Methological: Legal and illegal in Onion are distinct enough to be considered different domains (as distant as Legal and Ebay). 
Therefore, Tor could be a good testbed for working on legal and illegal classification.
