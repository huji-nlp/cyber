In order to analyze the named entities in each domain and the differences
between them we used a ``wikification'' technique, searching for
said entities in public datasets such as Wikipedia. 

Using SpaCy's named entity recognition, we first found all the named
entities in each site in the datasets. After finding the named entites
we searched for relevant Wikipedia entries for each named entity using
the DBpedia Ontology API. For each domain we counted the total number
of named entites and what percentage of them had corresponding Wikipedia
articles.

\begin{table}

\caption{Percentage of Wikifiable Named Entites per Domain}

\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline 
 & Percentage\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
Legal Onion & 50.8 $\pm2.31$\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
Illegal Onion & 32.5 $\pm1.35$\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
eBay & 38.6 $\pm2$\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}
\end{table}
According to our results (Table 1) the wikification percentages of
eBay sites and illegal Onion sites are comparable and relatively low.
However, sites selling legal drugs on Onion have a much higher wikification
percentage.

Presumably the named entities in Onion sites selling legal drugs are
more easily found in public databases such as Wikipedia because they
are mainly well known names for legal pharmaceuticals. However, in
both illegal Onion and eBay sites, the list of named entities include
many nicknames for illicit drugs and paraphernalia. These nicknames
are usually not well known by the general public and are therefore
less likely to be found on Wikipedia or other public databases.

In addition to the differences in wikification percentages between
the domains, we found that SpaCy had trouble correctly identifying
named entities in both Onion and eBay sites. There were a fair number
of false positives (words and phrases that were found by SpaCy but
were not actually named entities), especially in illegal Onion sites.
We believe the informal language used in our datasets makes it harder
for SpaCy to function optimally in this capacity.

These findings lead us to believe that the popular tools used today
for named entity recognition and analysis are not ideal for processing
informal language on the internet, especially language dealing in
illicit activities.
